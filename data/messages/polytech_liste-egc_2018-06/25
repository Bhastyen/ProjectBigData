  Call for Doctoral Consortium

PhD students working in the area of Business Process Management (BPM) 
are invited to submit their proposals for participation in a Doctoral 
Consortium, which will be held on Sunday, 9 September, 2018, in 
conjunction with the 16th International Conference on Business Process 
Management (BPM 2018) in Sydney, Australia 
(http://bpm2018.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/).

The Doctoral Consortium has the following objectives:

  * To provide valuable feedback on students’ research methods and plans
  * To provide helpful guidance on students’ research directions and topics
  * To promote the development of a community of scholars that will help
    students in their future careers
  * To provide students with opportunities to meet and interact with
    experienced researchers in the area of business process management

The PhD candidates of the accepted proposals are expected to present 
their research at the Doctoral Consortium. We welcome submissions 
representing a broad spectrum of research topics related to BPM. 
Participants will benefit from the advice of senior researchers in the 
field and from the interaction with peers being at a similar stage of 
their careers.


      SUBMISSION

PhD students interested in engaging in detailed discussions on their 
research at the Doctoral Consortium are invited to submit an extended 
abstract, which describes their thesis work and in particular provides 
clear discussions on:

  * The research problem being addressed
  * The research methodology and techniques being applied
  * The solution being proposed and its validity
  * The relation of the work to the state of the art in BPM research

The extended abstract should be discussed with the respective PhD 
supervisor before submission. It should be written in English using 11pt 
font and 1.5 line space in maximum 4 (A4) pages. It should be submitted 
(as a single PDF file) by midnight (EST) by 15 June 2018 via the BPM 
2018 Doctoral Consortium EasyChair Submission Website: 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2018


      REVIEW PROCESS

Submitted proposals will be reviewed by the Doctoral Consortium 
Committee. The review of the reported research work in each proposal 
will take into account its originality, its potential for advancing the 
BPM field, and whether the work is at a stage where the PhD candidate 
can benefit from participating in the consortium. Rejected submissions 
will receive written feedback. Confidentiality of submissions will be 
maintained throughout the review process.


      NOTIFICATION

Authors will be notified of the result of their submission by 15 July 
2018. Accepted doctoral candidates will receive instructions on how to 
submit a camera-ready copy of their proposal, and will receive 
information on the preparation of the presentation and poster (see “At 
The Conference” next).

Acceptance to the Doctoral Consortium is an honor. In turn, accepted 
candidates are expected to fully commit themselves to the success of the 
consortium by being open to new ideas and suggestions and providing 
ideas and suggestions to other participants. All accepted contributions 
will be circulated among the participants about one week before the 
consortium.


      AT THE CONFERENCE

*Attention:* Please present your work using whiteboard and pen. This 
allows the jury to discuss the essential parts of your thesis. Please 
prepare for not more than 20 minutes of presentation. The remaining time 
will be filled with discussions. Please DO NOT USE Powerpoint or some 
other presentation software, thanks.

Attendance of the Doctoral Consortium for accepted students is free of 
charge. Accepted submissions will be presented at the Doctoral 
Consortium, which is a venue open only to participants. All participants 
are expected to attend every session of the consortium. Each student 
will present his or her work to the group with substantial time provided 
for discussions and questions by participating researchers and other 
students. Additionally, participants are encouraged to attend the main 
conference and may have the option to present their work as a poster 
(registration fee for the main conference has to be covered by the 
participants).

    <h1>Call for Doctoral Consortium</h1>
    <p>PhD students working in the area of Business Process Management
      (BPM) are invited to submit their proposals for participation in a
      Doctoral Consortium, which will be held on Sunday, 9 September,
      2018, in conjunction with the 16th International Conference on
      Business Process Management (BPM 2018) in Sydney, Australia (<a
        href="http://bpm2018.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank">http://bpm2018.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/</a>).</p>
    <p>The Doctoral Consortium has the following objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide valuable feedback on students’ research methods and
        plans</li>
      <li>To provide helpful guidance on students’ research directions
        and topics</li>
      <li>To promote the development of a community of scholars that
        will help students in their future careers</li>
      <li>To provide students with opportunities to meet and interact
        with experienced researchers in the area of business process
        management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The PhD candidates of the accepted proposals are expected to
      present their research at the Doctoral Consortium. We welcome
      submissions representing a broad spectrum of research topics
      related to BPM. Participants will benefit from the advice of
      senior researchers in the field and from the interaction with
      peers being at a similar stage of their careers.</p>
    <h3>SUBMISSION</h3>
    <p>PhD students interested in engaging in detailed discussions on
      their research at the Doctoral Consortium are invited to submit an
      extended abstract, which describes their thesis work and in
      particular provides clear discussions on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The research problem being addressed</li>
      <li>The research methodology and techniques being applied</li>
      <li>The solution being proposed and its validity</li>
      <li>The relation of the work to the state of the art in BPM
        research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The extended abstract should be discussed with the respective PhD
      supervisor before submission. It should be written in English
      using 11pt font and 1.5 line space in maximum 4 (A4) pages. It
      should be submitted (as a single PDF file) by midnight (EST) by 15
      June 2018 via the BPM 2018 Doctoral Consortium EasyChair
      Submission Website: <a
        href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2018"
        target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2018</a></p>
    <h3>REVIEW PROCESS</h3>
    <p>Submitted proposals will be reviewed by the Doctoral Consortium
      Committee. The review of the reported research work in each
      proposal will take into account its originality, its potential for
      advancing the BPM field, and whether the work is at a stage where
      the PhD candidate can benefit from participating in the
      consortium. Rejected submissions will receive written feedback.
      Confidentiality of submissions will be maintained throughout the
      review process.</p>
    <h3>NOTIFICATION</h3>
    <p>Authors will be notified of the result of their submission by 15
      July 2018. Accepted doctoral candidates will receive instructions
      on how to submit a camera-ready copy of their proposal, and will
      receive information on the preparation of the presentation and
      poster (see “At The Conference” next).</p>
    <p>Acceptance to the Doctoral Consortium is an honor. In turn,
      accepted candidates are expected to fully commit themselves to the
      success of the consortium by being open to new ideas and
      suggestions and providing ideas and suggestions to other
      participants. All accepted contributions will be circulated among
      the participants about one week before the consortium.</p>
    <h3>AT THE CONFERENCE</h3>
    <p><strong>Attention:</strong> Please present your work using
      whiteboard and pen. This allows the jury to discuss the essential
      parts of your thesis. Please prepare for not more than 20 minutes
      of presentation. The remaining time will be filled with
      discussions. Please DO NOT USE Powerpoint or some other
      presentation software, thanks.</p>
    <p>Attendance of the Doctoral Consortium for accepted students is
      free of charge. Accepted submissions will be presented at the
      Doctoral Consortium, which is a venue open only to participants.
      All participants are expected to attend every session of the
      consortium. Each student will present his or her work to the group
      with substantial time provided for discussions and questions by
      participating researchers and other students. Additionally,
      participants are encouraged to attend the main conference and may
      have the option to present their work as a poster (registration
      fee for the main conference has to be covered by the
      participants).</p>
