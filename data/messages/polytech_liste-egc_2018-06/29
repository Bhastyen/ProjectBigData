Special Issue of the Journal of Applied Ontology "Meaning in Context: ont=
ologically and linguistically motivated representations of objects and ev=
ents."


https://submissions.iospress.com/applied-ontology/CIM


Overview


Dealing with context is a key factor in the conceptualization of human ex=
perience, and a major issue for understanding natural language. It is wel=
l known that some properties of objects and events may have different cog=
nitive salience according to their context of occurrence, thus determinin=
g access to partial relevant information rather than to all information. =
One typical example is that of an orange being passed between two childre=
n, or the same orange peeled on a table: in the former case the roundness=
 prevails over other traits, and the orange is being used to play; in the=
 latter one, the edible features are those mostly conveyed by the scene. =
Interpreting events poses contextual challenges as well: (in how far) doe=
s a given event allow for different interpretations, like it might happen=
 for revenge/self defense? Similar selectional mechanisms underlie figura=
tive uses of word meanings, such as metonymy and metaphors among others, =
that intrinsically characterize the interface between knowledge and langu=
age.
Contextual access to objects and events needs to be further investigated,=
 shared conceptualizations and terminologies are needed, as well as more =
robust approaches, including connections to domain and formal ontologies.=
  The design of ontological and linguistic resources that account for the=
 semantic phenomena involved in the contextual interpretation of objects =
and events requires collecting information and devising context-aware pro=
cedures.


In an era where most research is committed to statistical approaches, e.g=
=2E vector representations of the linguistic context and neural architect=
ures, pairing the natural language semantic interpretation process and fo=
rmal ontology may improve the inferential capacities of artificial agents=
 with the explanatory power that is less relevant in those mainstream app=
roaches.
Methods traditionally adopted to elaborate text documents exhibit limitat=
ions in representing and processing objects and events. Many efforts are =
being put in grasping text documents=E2=80=99 semantics based on semantic=
ally shallow approaches, whilst natural language inference demands for de=
ep interpretation models, allowing to handle properties, functions, and r=
oles, among others, to deal with commonsense and to produce explanations.=

A different approach relies on lexical information: several large-scale l=
exical resources, such as WordNet (https://wordnet.princeton.edu), BabelN=
et (http://babelnet.org), FrameNet (https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fn=
drupal/), and ImagAct (http://imagact.lablita.it/index.php?lang=3Den), am=
ong others, have been proposed in the last few years and have been succes=
sfully employed to bridge the gap between knowledge representations and n=
atural language. However, to cope with contextual access to objects and e=
vents involves many additional features still lacking in such resources. =
Neither shallow representations of NL semantics nor lexical resources alo=
ne provide sufficient ground to account for contextual phenomena.


Relevant areas include, but are not limited to: events representation and=
 retrieval, event sequences, contextual features representation, trend de=
tection, knowledge discovery, word sense disambiguation, ontology alignme=
nt, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, and conceptual similarity, amo=
ng others. All proposed approaches must address the issue of representati=
on of context, and suitable procedures to use context and context aware m=
eaning representations of objects and events. The ideal submission should=
 provide evidence that context improves the performance of systems on rea=
l-world applications and/or provides useful insights and explanations on =
systems=E2=80=99 output.


Topics of Interest


Research works submitted to the special issue should foster scientific ad=
vances whether and to what extent objects and events representation and p=
rocessing can be linked to the context where they occur. The following is=
 a tentative list of relevant topics:


- theoretical foundations for the use of AI techniques to deal with conte=
xt and with changing/evolving objects and events;
- KR frameworks to represent mutable/evolving objects and events, includi=
ng formal ontologies, conceptual spaces and distributed representations;
- formal methods for reasoning in evolving scenarios;
- theoretical, methodological, experimental, and application-oriented asp=
ects of knowledge engineering and knowledge management centered on events=
 and evolving objects;
- use cases and application scenarios (e.g., in law, medicine) where cont=
extual information impacts on objects/events representation and processin=
g;
- linguistic approaches to context analysis;
- context-aware lexical resources to describe objects and events;
- context-aware topic and event detection and tracking, knowledge discove=
ry;
- context-aware frame semantics;
- entity linking and  word sense disambiguation;
- representation of context in the Semantic Web;
- surveys on the adoption of contextual information in Cognitive Science,=
 NLP and Ontological Modeling;
- context-based explainable Artificial Intelligence.
