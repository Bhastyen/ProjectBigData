NEW M.Sc. Program in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science
Universit=C3=A9 de Lorraine, Nancy (France)


The Institute of Digital science, Management and Cognition=20
is opening a a new Masters Program in NLP - =E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B
Computer Sciences, Speech, Language and Knowledge Representation

**************
        =
http://institut-sciences-digitales.fr/idmc-master-degree-in-natural-langua=
ge-processing/ =
<http://institut-sciences-digitales.fr/idmc-master-degree-in-natural-langu=
age-processing/>
**************

So you want to be a specialist in Neural Networks, Logic, Speech=20
Processing, Information Retrieval, Knowledge Representation ... all=20
for Natural Language? Well, now's your chance!

Natural Language Processing (NLP) lies at the crossroads of=20
linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence. This
Masters Program offers
a modern curriculum which combines the different=20
approaches, and  covers both theoretical and applied perspectives.


In each semester, the program includes a hands-on project.=20
It ends with a 6-month paid internship in a company or a research=20
lab. You can find the course description below.


=
--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------------
You can apply to directly enter at either the first year or second year =
level.
=
--------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------------

Language
-------------
All courses are taught in English
(except the "French for non-native Speakers" class).


Fees
-------
The University of Lorraine is publicly funded and thus offers=20
tuition-free education for all students including students from=20
both inside and outside EU/EEA/EFTA countries. The only student=20
expenditures are a nominal semester fee of about 600 euros which=20
includes health insurance. Nancy=E2=80=99s high quality of life goes=20
hand-in-hand with a low cost of living.

Why Nancy?
---------------
Nancy is a center of excellence for NLP. It can boast of:

1/Two important research units:
- LORIA, the computer science research laboratory =
http://www.loria.fr/en/ <http://www.loria.fr/en/>
- ATILF the linguistic research laboratory lab http://www.atilf.fr/ =
<http://www.atilf.fr/>

Both research units participate in many national and=20
international research projects. Their members are highly=20
visible in the international community and regularly publish=20
in the most prestigious conferences and journals of the field.

2/ Two Erasmus Mundus Masters funded by the European Union :=20
- Erasmus Mundus Master Language and Communication=20
Technology (LCT) http://lct-master.org/ <http://lct-master.org/>
- Erasmus Mundus Master EMLex.
        https://www.emlex.phil.fau.eu/ <https://www.emlex.phil.fau.eu/>


Why NLP?
--------------
Natural Language Processing is a rapidly expanding field.

With the proliferation of digital data, there is a massive need=20
for well-trained engineers and researchers able to exploit this=20
data for commercial (for example: e-commerce, recommendation=20
systems and translation) and socio-political (for example:=20
e-learning, opinion mining, and behavioural predictions) purposes.

Start-ups, small firms with strong R&D profiles and large companies=20
(in France this includes Airbus, Thales, EDF, and Orange) are=20
looking for scientists and engineers who can contribute to the=20
development of systems capable of managing and exploiting textual=20
data.

The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft) also recruit=20
intensively in both the NLP and the Speech processing domain.

There is also a strong need for Ph.D. candidates in the field, as=20
is demonstrated by the many Ph.D. proposals in both the public and=20
the industrial domain.
