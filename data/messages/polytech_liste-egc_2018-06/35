Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: 2nd International Workshop on Uncertainty in Cloud
 Computing (UCC@CloudCom)

[Our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this CFP]

CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------

2nd International Workshop on Uncertainty in Cloud Computing (UCC 2018)
https://sites.google.com/site/ucc18workshop/

Held in parallel with
10th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and 
Science (CloudCom 2018).
Nicosia, Cyprus
December 10-13, 2018

---------------------------------

With the goal to introduce participants to the concept of Uncertain 
Cloud, UCC 2018 is an opportunity for researchers to publish their 
original research works that deal with uncertainty issues in various 
cloud computing topics.

AIMS AND SCOPE:
Cloud computing is an emerging technology that offers various services 
on demand. The correct characterization and management of Cloud 
environment objects (clouds, data centers, providers, services, data, 
users, etc.) is the first step towards effective provisioning and 
integration of cloud services. However, Cloud computing environment is 
often subject to uncertainty. This could be attributed to the 
incompleteness and imprecision of Cloud available information, as well 
as the highly dynamic environment.
Cloud services are associated with some uncertainty in their 
information, including QoS levels, users rating, available resources, 
workload and performance changes, dynamic elasticity, availability 
zones, service descriptions, etc. Also, the highly dynamic cloud 
environment adds a new factor of uncertainty, as it may have a negative 
impact on the quality of cloud services and, consequently, on services 
provisioning and integration. This uncertainty regarding the cloud 
services context raises a question about how to trust the available 
cloud information and brings additional challenges to the cloud actors. 
Therefore, the need to handle uncertainty in the context of cloud 
environments is of paramount importance to maintain the sustainable use 
of such technology.
Extensive research has been conducted to address uncertainty issues in 
various fields including computational biology, e-commerce, social 
networks, decision making, data integration, location-based services, 
and recently Internet of Things. However, uncertainty issues in the 
context of Cloud computing have not been solved yet. A main motivation 
behind addressing uncertainty in the cloud, to satisfy user needs, is 
the growing reliance on such highly dynamic cross-platform also 
considered as a big distributed container of uncertain Cloud services 
and their related data.

TOPICS OF INTEREST:
By organizing this workshop, we aim to collect recent and significant 
solutions in the area of uncertain Cloud.
We look for original and high quality submissions related to (but not 
limited to) the following topics:

Uncertainty models for Clouds, services and users.
Techniques and methods for uncertainty assessment in Cloud computing.
Cloud service provisioning and composition under uncertainty.
Service retrieval and discovery of Cloud availability zones under 
uncertainty.
Data quality in uncertain Cloud.
Uncertain data integration and Database-as-a-Service.
Uncertain databases and multi-databases in the uncertain cloud.
Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in uncertain cloud.
Reasoning over uncertain cloud services.
Reputation and trust management of cloud services under uncertainty.
Uncertainty and data provenance in multi-cloud environments.
Bayesian and probabilistic models and their relevance to the uncertain 
cloud.
Specifying and controlling uncertain cloud services elasticity.
Uncertainty and fuzziness in multi-cloud environments.
Uncertainty-aware resource provisioning in the multi-cloud.
Formal and fuzzy methods and theoretical algorithms for uncertain Cloud.
Service and data placement approaches under uncertainty.
Security and privacy in uncertain Clouds.

PAPER SUBMISSION:
Authors are invited to electronically submit original research 
contributions or experience reports in English. The submitted 
manuscripts should not exceed 6 pages and must be prepared according to 
the IEEE CS format 
(https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, 
significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.
For paper submission use the EasyChair submission system 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ucc18.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Full paper submission: September 15, 2018
Notification of acceptance: October 15, 2018
Camera-ready copies due: October 30, 2018
Workshop date: December 10, 2018

ACCEPTED PAPERS:
All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings of CloudCom18 
by IEEE Conference Publishing Services (CPS) with ISBN and ISSN.
At least, one author of each accepted paper must register to CloudCom18 
and present the paper at UCC18 workshop.
For registration, authors can be referred to the IEEE CloudCom 
conference registration page.
