Apologies for cross postings

12th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval GIR'18
at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2018
6th November 2018, Seattle, Washington, USA.

First Call for Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.geo.uzh.ch/~rsp/gir18/
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first call for papers for the 12th Workshop on Geographic =
Information Retrieval (GIR'18), to be held on the 6th November 2018 in =
Seattle, Washington, USA. The workshop continues the successful series =
of workshops held in cooperation with ACM SIGSPATIAL and previously with =
SIGIR and CIKM conferences.

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together members of the vibrant =
and growing community of researchers and practitioners working in the =
field of geographic information retrieval to discuss current research =
activity and potential future research directions.


The subject and format of the workshop
-----------------------------------------------------

There is a vast quantity of information in text documents and other =
media that is referenced to geographic space. The discipline of =
Geographical Information Retrieval (GIR) is concerned with developing =
methods to gain access to this geographical information, with a =
particular focus on the content of web documents and social media. =
Because much of the information is in the form of unstructured or =
semi-structured text, there is a challenge to develop methods that can =
automatically recognise and interpret the geographical terminology and =
spatial or spatio-temporal concepts that people use when recording and =
querying the information. GIR falls at the intersection of Information =
Retrieval (IR) and Geographical Information Science (GIScience) =
resulting in research and systems development that benefit from the =
fusion of text-based methods for information extraction, natural =
language processing, indexing and search with GIS methods for spatial =
data management, analysis and visualiza!
tion.

The workshop invites contributions on the following topics, and other =
research related to GIR:

*  Detection, disambiguation and geocoding of geographical references in =
text;

*  User needs for geographic search;

*  Classification of web documents and of social media with regard to =
their geographic foci;

*  Interpretation of spatial natural language in documents and queries;

*  Exploitation of the thematic content of web documents and social =
media for categorisation and characterisation of locations;


*  Extraction of geographically-specific facts and events from text =
documents and social media;

*  Spatial and spatio-temporal indexing of documents and other media =
objects;

*  Modelling, construction and integration of ontologies, gazetteers and =
geographic thesauri;

*  Reasoning with geo-spatial facts for purposes of information =
retrieval;

*  Geographical query interfaces for search on the web;

*  Geographic question / answering systems;

*  Geographic search engine architectures;

*  Relevance ranking of geographical information;

*  Evaluation methods for geographic search;

*  Applications of GIR methods.


We invite both long papers (10 pages) and short papers (2 pages). Long =
papers are expected to report on relatively mature research results, =
while short papers may cover more speculative or early stage research =
that will stimulate discussion at the workshop.=20

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the programme =
committee and we plan to publish accepted papers in the ACM Digital =
Library.

Please note that we welcome contributions both from academic researchers =
and from practitioners working in industry and in public agencies =
engaged in GIR-related activities.

The workshop programme will ensure opportunity for discussion of the =
presented papers and of the broader agenda for research in GIR.

Submission procedure
------------------------------
You should prepare your paper in accordance with the ACM camera-ready
instructions =
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates)
and submit it using the EasyChair system
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgir18).

The deadline for submission is 3rd September 2018.=20

Decisions on acceptance will be announced by 28th September 2018.

Camera ready versions of accepted papers to be submitted by 8th October =
2018.

At least one author of accepted papers will be required to register for =
the workshop before the paper is published, and to present the paper at =
the workshop.

Further details of the workshop can be found at

http://www.geo.uzh.ch/~rsp/gir18/

Please forward this message to anyone you think may have an interest in =
the workshop.

With best wishes,
