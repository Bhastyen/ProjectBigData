Dear colleagues,=20

Special Issue On: Swarm Intelligence in Ecological System Modelling to be p=
ublishzd in the International Journal of Swarm Intelligence Research (IJSIR=
) (indexed by Thomson, Scopus, ...)=20

Submission Due Date=20
8/31/2018=20

Guest Editors=20

Introduction=20
Computer modeling of ecological systems is the activity of implementing com=
puter solutions to analyze data related to the fields of remote sensing, ea=
rth science, biology and oceans. The ecologists analyze the data to identif=
y the relationships between a response and a set of predictors, using stati=
stical models that do not accurately describe the main sources of variation=
 in the response variable. Knowledge discovery techniques are often more po=
werful, flexible and effective for exploratory analysis than statistical te=
chniques. Data mining is not only a matter of grouping or classifying data =
but optimizing exploration itself is an area of major importance in enginee=
ring fields in general. The problems NP-Hard Are difficult problems to be s=
olved by conventional techniques. The increase of such kinds of problems ha=
s created an active research topic, from which researchers try to develop m=
athematical techniques to find the best possible solutions for a given prob=
lem. Optimization methods are divided into two categories: deterministic me=
thods that are the oldest. These methods require a great effort to make cal=
culations, which gives a greater limit in terms of complexity when the size=
 of the problem increases. This gives the motivation to invent new techniqu=
es which consist in using a random computation and a local search to solve =
an optimization problem based on iterative improvements of a population of =
solutions or a unique solution. These methods have been brought together in=
 a field called Bio-inspiration and meta-heuristics. One of the most succes=
sful techniques in bio-inspiration and meta heuritsics, are swarm intellige=
nce. A swarm-based algorithm is an algorithm from which the solutions prese=
nt particles with irregular movements in the search space. These algorithms=
 are decentralized and self-organized processes in food research.=20

Objective=20
This special issue aims to collect new original researches that apply swarm=
 intelligence techniques on ecological system data modelling. New contribut=
ions are welcomed as well as state of the art of application of swarm intel=
ligence to analyze ecological data.=20
