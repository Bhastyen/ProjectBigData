__________________________________________________________________________

The 6th Symposium on Conceptual Modeling Education (SCME 2018) aims at
providing a forum
for discussing education and teaching of concepts related to conceptual
modeling.
We invite submissions from the communities of information systems,
databases, software engineering,
web applications, business process modeling, enterprise content management
systems,
ontologies and websemantic, and related areas.

Topics of interest include all those that discuss the teaching and
learning of any conceptual modeling topics,
as they appear in the Call for Papers of ER 2018
(http://www.nwpu-bioinformatics.com/ER2018/).

We solicit papers that describe methods, experience,and practices of
teaching and educating conceptual modeling
to both the academic and industry communities.

Typical topics of research papers can be (but are not limited to) the
following:

    Gamification in conceptual modeling education
    E-learning/e-teaching of conceptual modeling
    Cooperation between industry and academia
    Conceptual modeling education in academic graduate/undergraduate programs
    Vision for conceptual modeling education in the future
    Critical factors for successful conceptual modeling education
    Methodological aspects of conceptual modeling education
    Domain conceptual modeling education
    Description of tools for assisting education in conceptual modeling
    Empirical studies related to conceptual modeling education (controlled
experiments, case studies, etc.)
    Challenges in conceptual modeling education
    Tools for teaching conceptual modelling
