We invite submissions to the MIDAS Workshop on MIning DAta for financial
applicationS,
to be held in conjunction with ECML-PKDD 2016 - European Conference on
Machine Learning and
Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery.

Like the famous King Midas, popularly remembered in Greek mythology for his
ability to turn
everything he touched with his hand into gold, we believe that the wealth
of data generated
by modern technologies, with widespread presence of computers, users and
media connected by
Internet, is a goldmine for tackling a variety of problems in the financial
domain.

Nowadays, people's interactions with technological systems provide us with
gargantuan amounts
of data documenting collective behaviour in a previously unimaginable
fashion.
Recent research has shown that by properly modeling and analyzing these
massive datasets, or
instance representing them as network structures it is possible to gain
useful insights into
the evolution of the systems considered (i.e., trading, disease spreading,
political elections).

Investigating the impact of data arising from today's application domains
on financial decisions
may be of paramount importance. Knowledge extracted from data can help
gather critical information
for trading decisions, reveal early signs of impactful events (such as
stock market moves), or
anticipate catastrophic events (e.g., financial crises) that result from a
combination of actions,
and affect humans worldwide.

The importance of data-mining tasks in the financial domain has been long
recognized.
Core application scenarios include correlating Web-search data with
financial decisions,
forecasting stock market, predicting bank bankruptcies, understanding and
managing financial risk,
trading futures, credit rating, loan management, bank customer profiling.

The MIDAS workshop is aimed at discussing challenges, potentialities, and
applications of
leveraging data-mining tasks to tackle problems in the financial domain.
The workshop provides a premier forum for sharing findings, knowledge,
insights, experience
and lessons learned from mining data generated in various application
domains.
The intrinsic interdisciplinary nature of the workshop constitutes an
invaluable opportunity
to promote interaction between computer scientists, physicists,
mathematicians, economists and
financial analysts, thus paving the way for an exciting and stimulating
environment involving
researchers and practitioners from different areas.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
------------------
We encourage submission of papers on the area of data mining for financial
applications.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Forecasting the stock market
- Trading models
- Discovering market trends
- Predictive analytics for financial services
- Network analytics in finance
- Planning investment strategies
- Portfolio management
- Understanding and managing financial risk
- Customer/investor profiling
- Identifying expert investors
- Financial modeling
- Measures of success in forecasting
- Anomaly detection in financial data

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------
We invite submissions of either regular papers (long or short), and
extended abstracts.

Regular papers may be up to 12 pages (long papers) or 6 pages (short
papers) in the
Springer LNCS style  (
https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-6-793341-0),
and should report on novel, unpublished work that might not be mature
enough for a conference
or journal submission.
Extended abstracts may be up to 2 pages long, and present work-in-progress,
recently published
work fitting the workshop topics, or position papers.

Contributions should be submitted in PDF format, electronically,  using the
workshop
submission site at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmidas2016.
Papers must be written in English and formatted according to the ECML-PKDD
2016
submission guidelines available at
http://www.ecmlpkdd2016.org/submission.html.

Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and selected on the basis of these
reviews.
If accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to
present the work.


PROCEEDINGS
-----------
Accepted papers will be part of the workshop proceedings which will be made
available online
at both the workshop website and the CEUR workshop proceedings publication
service
(http://ceur-ws.org/).
The CEUR service ensures that the published papers are permanently
available and citable.
Workshop proceedings will also be indexed by major digital libraries
(e.g., DBLP, Scopus, GoogleScholar, CiteSeerX).

Additionally, based on the success of the workshop, extended versions of
selected papers
will be published either as a post-proceeding volume of the Springer LNAI
series or as a
special issue of a premier journal in the fields of interest of the
workshop.


IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
Submission deadline: July 4, 2016
Acceptance notification: July 25, 2016
Camera-ready deadline: August 8, 2016
