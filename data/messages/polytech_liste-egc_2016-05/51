---- AIMS AND TOPICS

Environmental and more generally geo-spatial information is now provided =
by crowdsourcing but also by public administrations in the context of =
the open data policies. Analyses of such data are still challenging. =
Firstly because of their heterogeneity (structural, semantic, spatial =
and temporal), and secondly because of the difficulty in choosing the =
"best" knowledge discovery process to apply, according to the needs of =
the experts in the field. This special issue aims to provide high =
quality research covering all or part of the challenges mentioned above, =
from a theoretical or experimental point of view.

Challenge about data science deals with creation, storage, search, =
sharing, modeling, analysis, and visualization of data, information, and =
knowledge. In Data Science context, spatio-temporal aspects are crucial =
in order to manage and mine data, to index and retrieve information, and =
finally to discover and visualize knowledge. By taking into account =
these spatio-temporal aspects, original methods have to be proposed for =
processing real and complex data from different domains, e.g., =
environment, agriculture, health, urban, and so forth.

Topics:=20
- Pre and Post Data processing
- Data Quality, and Result Evaluation
- Data Mining or Data Warehousing Applications
- Text-Mining or Information Retrieval
- Visual Analytics
- KDD real use-cases dedicated to environmental and geo-spatial Data
