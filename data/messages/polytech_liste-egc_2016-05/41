http://www.icsoc.org <http://www.icsoc.org/>

The ICSOC=E2=80=99'2016 PhD Symposium is an international forum for PhD =
students working in all areas related to service-oriented computing.
The goals of the symposium are:
* To bring together PhD students and established researchers in the =
field of service-oriented computing,
* To enable PhD students to interact with other PhD students and to =
stimulate exchange of ideas, suggestions, and experiences among =
participants,
* To provide PhD students an opportunity to present, share and discuss =
their research in a constructive and critical atmosphere, and
* To provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their =
research approach.

This symposium in Banff (Canada) will be the 12th edition of the series =
held in conjunction with the ICSOC conferences in Goa (2015), Paris =
(2014), Berlin (2013), Shanghai (2012), Paphos (2011), San Francisco =
(2010), Stockholm (2009), Sydney (2008), Vienna (2007), Chicago (2006), =
and Amsterdam (2005).

PhD students working in all areas related to service-oriented computing =
are invited to submit a paper providing a clear description of the PhD =
work. In particular each paper must:
* Provide a clear problem statement,
* Outline the research challenges that drive the proposed work,
* Describe the proposed solution, its expected impact, the expected =
research plan, and the preliminary results,
* Discuss the progress beyond the state of the art of the envisioned =
research outcome compared to current literature and approaches, and
* Discuss how the work will be evaluated, stating how the suggested =
solution is different, new, or better than existing approaches to the =
problem.

Accepted papers presented at the Symposium will be included in the =
ICSOC=E2=80=9916 post-conference proceedings of satellite events, to be =
published by Springer in the Service Science series.
