CALL FOR PAPERS ISCRAM-MED 2016
3rd International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response
and Management in Mediterranean Countries

Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain
October, 26-28, 2016

============================== =========================
Paper Submission deadline: May 29th, 2016

http://dei.inf.uc3m.es/ iscrammed2016/ [1]
============================== =========================

The Third International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis
Response and Management in Mediterranean Countries (ISCRAM-med 2016), is
an ISCRAM event organized in Mediterranean countries, alternating
between the north and the south of the Mediterranean Sea. The previous
ISCRAM-med conferences were successfully held in Toulouse, France
(October, 15-17, 2014) and in Tunis, Tunisia (October, 28-30, 2015). The
next ISCRAM-med 2016 will be held in Madrid (Leganés), Spain (October,
26-28, 2016). 

The ISCRAM-med Conference aims to provide an outstanding opportunity and
an international forum for local and international researchers,
practitioners and policy makers to address and discuss new trends and
challenges in the area of Information Systems and Technologies for
Crisis Response and Management. Attendees are invited to present and
discuss their experiences, their recent research results, best
practices, case studies, and also tool demonstrations related to social,
technical and practical aspects of all information and communication
systems used or to be used in all phases of management of emergencies,
disasters and crises. 

A special focus on Mediterranean related experiences will be
appreciated. Many crises have occurred in recent years around the
Mediterranean Sea. Also, the shared history between the Mediterranean
countries and common geo-political issues led to solidarity among people
and cross-country interventions. This observation proves the importance
of considering some of these crises in this region at a Mediterranean
level rather than as isolated phenomena. It becomes appropriate now to
exchange and share information and knowledge about the course and
management of these crises and also to get the point of view of
stakeholders, practitioners and policy makers.

ISCRAM-med 2016 will include a high quality scientific program, invited
speakers, posters and demonstration's sessions.

As with the previous ISCRAM-med, ACCEPTED PAPERS WILL BE PUBLISHED IN
THE SPRINGER SERIES “LECTURE NOTES IN BUSINESS INFORMATION PROCESSING”
(LNBIP).Publication in the proceedings is subject to the registration of
at least one author of the paper.

============================== =========================
Important Dates for authors:

Abstract deadline (recommended): May 22th, 2016 
Full and short papers and demos submission deadline: May 29th, 2016 
Authors' notification: July 1st, 2016
