--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      FIRST CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    The Eleventh International Workshop on
                             ONTOLOGY MATCHING
                                     (OM-2016)
http://om2016.ontologymatching.org/
                 October 17th or 18th, ISWC Workshop Program,
                                    Kobe, Japan
BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
Ontology matching is a key interoperability enabler for the Semantic Web,
as well as a useful tactic in some classical data integration tasks
dealing with the semantic heterogeneity problem. It takes ontologies
as input and determines as output an alignment, that is, a set of
correspondences between the semantically related entities of those 
ontologies.
These correspondences can be used for various tasks, such as ontology
merging, data translation, query answering or navigation on the web of 
data.
Thus, matching ontologies enables the knowledge and data expressed
in the matched ontologies to interoperate.

The workshop has three goals:
1.
To bring together leaders from academia, industry and user institutions
to assess how academic advances are addressing real-world requirements.
The workshop will strive to improve academic awareness of industrial
and final user needs, and therefore, direct research towards those needs.
Simultaneously, the workshop will serve to inform industry and user
representatives about existing research efforts that may meet their
requirements. The workshop will also investigate how the ontology
matching technology is going to evolve.

2. To conduct an extensive and rigorous evaluation of ontology matching
and instance matching (link discovery) approaches through
the OAEI (Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative) 2016 campaign.
Besides real-world specific matching tasks, involving e.g.,
large biomedical ontologies, OAEI-16 will introduce
the process model matching track as well as a desease-phenotype track
supported by the Pistoia Alliance Ontologies Mapping project
within a specific matching scenario. Therefore, the ontology matching
evaluation initiative itself will provide a solid ground for discussion
of how well the current approaches are meeting business needs.

3. To examine new uses, similarities and differences from database
schema matching, which has received decades of attention
but is just beginning to transition to mainstream tools.

This year, in sync with the main conference, we encourage submissions
specifically devoted to: (i) datasets, benchmarks and replication studies,
services, software, methodologies, protocols and measures
(not necessarily related to OAEI), and (ii) application of
the matching technology in real-life scenarios and assessment
of its usefulness to the final users.

TOPICS of interest include but are not limited to:
     Business and use cases for matching;
     Requirements to matching from specific application scenarios;
     Application of matching techniques in real-world scenarios;
     Formal foundations and frameworks for matching;
     Matching and big data;
     Matching and linked data;
     Instance matching, data interlinking and relations between them;
     Process model matching;
     Large-scale and efficient matching techniques;
     Matcher selection, combination and tuning;
     User involvement (including both technical and organizational aspects);
     Explanations in matching;
     Social and collaborative matching;
     Uncertainty in matching;
     Reasoning with alignments;
     Alignment coherence and debugging;
     Alignment management;
     Matching for traditional applications (e.g., information integration);
     Matching for emerging applications (e.g., search, web-services).


SUBMISSIONS
Contributions to the workshop can be made in terms of technical papers and
posters/statements of interest addressing different issues of ontology 
matching
as well as participating in the OAEI 2016 campaign. Technical papers should
be not longer than 12 pages using the LNCS Style:
