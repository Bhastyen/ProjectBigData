Subject: [liste-egc] GIR'16: First call for paper

Apologies for cross postings

10th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval GIR'16=20
31st October 2016, San Francisco, USA @ ACM SIGSPATIAL

First Call for Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.geo.uzh.ch/~rsp/gir16/
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first call for papers for the 10th Workshop on Geographic =
Information Retrieval (GIR'16), to be held on 31st October 2016 in =
conjunction with the ACM SIGSPATIAL 2016 conference in San Francisco. =
The workshop continues the successful series of workshops held in =
cooperation with ACM SIGSPATIAL and previously with SIGIR and CIKM =
conferences.


The purpose of the workshop is to bring together members of the vibrant =
and growing community of researchers and practitioners working in the =
field of geographic information retrieval to discuss current research =
activity and potential future research directions.


The subject and format of the workshop
-----------------------------------------------------

There is a vast quantity of information in text documents and other =
media that is referenced to geographic space. The discipline of =
Geographical Information Retrieval (GIR) is concerned with developing =
methods to gain access to this geographical information, with a =
particular focus on the content of web documents and of social media =
such as micro-blogs and tagged images. Because much of the information =
is in the form of unstructured or semi-structured text, there is a =
challenge to develop methods that can automatically recognise and =
interpret the geographical terminology and spatial or spatio-temporal =
concepts that people use when recording and querying the information. =
GIR falls at the intersection of Information Retrieval (IR) and =
Geographical Information Science (GIScience) resulting in research and =
systems development that benefits from the fusion of text-based methods =
for information extraction, natural language processing, indexing and =
search with GIS methods for spati!
al data management, analysis and visualization.

The workshop invites contributions on the following topics, and other =
research related to GIR:

*  Detection, disambiguation and geocoding of geographical references in =
text;

*  User needs for geographic search;

*  Classification of web documents and of social media with regard to =
their geographic foci;

*  Interpretation of spatial natural language in documents and queries;

*  Extraction of geographically-specific facts and events from text =
documents and social media;

*  Spatial and spatio-temporal indexing of documents and other media =
objects;

*  Modelling, construction and integration of ontologies, gazetteers and =
geographic thesauri;

*  Reasoning with geo-spatial facts for purposes of information =
retrieval;

*  Geographical query interfaces for search on the web;

*  Geographic question / answering systems;

*  Geographic search engine architectures;

*  Relevance ranking of geographical information;

*  Evaluation methods for geographic search.

* Applications of GIR in fields such as GIScience and the digital =
humanities.

We invite both long papers (10 pages) and short papers (2 pages). Long =
papers are expected to report on relatively mature research results, =
while short papers may also cover more speculative or early stage =
research that may stimulate discussion at the workshop.=20

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the programme =
committee and we plan to publish accepted papers in the ACM Digital =
Library.

Please note that we welcome contributions both from academic researchers =
and from practitioners working in industry and in public agencies =
engaged in GIR-related activities.

The workshop programme will ensure opportunity for discussion of the =
presented papers and of the broader agenda for research in GIR.

Submission procedure
------------------------------
You should prepare your paper in accordance with the ACM camera-ready
instructions =
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates)
and submit it using the EasyChair system
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dgir16).

The deadline for submission is 19th August 2016.=20

Decisions on acceptance will be announced by 9th September 2016.
Camera ready versions of accepted papers to be submitted by 7th October =
2016.

At least one author of accepted papers will be required to register for =
the workshop before the paper is published, and to present the paper at =
the workshop.
