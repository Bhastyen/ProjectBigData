Subject: [liste-egc] 3-year fully funded PhD position in the research area
 of Big Data in the MIDI team of the ETIS Lab (ENSEA / UCP / CNRS) UMR
 8051, Paris, France

The MIDI team of the ETIS Lab (ENSEA / UCP / CNRS) UMR 8051
(www-etis.ensea.fr) has available a 3-year fully funded PhD position in
the research area of Big Data. The lab is located in the Cergy-Pontoise
area in the greater area of Paris, France.

During this PhD we want to investigate crowd sourced Big Data, generated
by users who do not follow a well-documented method that could ensure
data quality. The quality of these data and their descriptions might
vary depending on the source, the type of the metadata included (or the
lack thereof) and the person who is referencing them. This problem
becomes more evident when we talk about georeferenced crowd sourced data
where we are facing problems of completeness of the information (since
usually people provide online information that refers to their
interests) and the coherence of the information (and thus its semantic
quality), including ambiguity or conversion issues. Moreover, we can
identify quality issues that can be attributed to the timeliness of the
information (since several types information do not disappear over time
e.g. social media posts) and of logical consistency (since we can find
online conflicting descriptions on e.g. Points of Interest). There is
also a heterogeneity in the level of detail of the crowd sourced
information because the level of abstraction of the user capturing
information is closely related to her interests. Another important
question in this area is how the techniques of big data quality
enhancement affect the privacy of the users.
Based on the above during this PhD we would like to work on how to:
1. Deal with incompleteness of information by combining information on
entities from diverse sources through applying entity resolution (ER)
techniques to a large scale, e.g. combining information from social
networks, trajectory information on various platforms, crowd-sourced
geographical information like Open Street Maps
2. Increase the quality of the data presented to the end user by
understanding the repairs that can be introduced at the crowd-sourced
platforms
3. Understand the level of information exposed by increasing the quality
of information for the user.

We expect the successful applicant to be one of the driving forces
behind the group's research efforts in the areas mentioned above. He/She
will join our international research group and work with other groups in
the lab as well as with a strong network of national and international
collaborators. The successful applicant will work with Professor
Dimitris Kotzinos and Assistant Professor Claudia Marinica and will join
a group with 3 professors and 5 assistant professors. Knowledge of
French is not a requirement.

Starting Date: October 2016

Application: If interested, please send your application (including a
detailed CV, university transcripts, a copy of the master thesis or
scientific papers if available, as well as a list of personal references
and and a motivation letter) in PDF format to Professor Dimitris
Kotzinos (Dimitrios.Kotzinos@u-cergy.fr). Further enquires are also welcome.
Applications are welcome until 25/05/2016 or until the position is filled.
