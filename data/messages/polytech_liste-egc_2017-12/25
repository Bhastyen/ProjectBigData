We are seeking an outstanding postdoctoral research fellow with =
experience in deep learning to work with us at Caen University, France =
on a project investigating the design of algorithms for speaker =
identification for intelligent home speakers.

Context:
---------
The postdoctoral position is funded under the research project =
HomeKeeper supported by the French National Future Investments Program. =
The HomeKeeper project gathers companies and universities around the =
design of a personal home speaker assistant that communicates with =
humans through sound media. Within this framework, the personal =
assistant should be able to discriminate the different persons living in =
a house and entitled to communicate with it.

Background:
-----------
Intelligent Home Speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home are a =
causing a wave of excitement amongst consumers. Their shipments reached =
5.9 million units globally in 2016 and should grow tenfold by 2022. The =
promise of conversational, hands-free interaction with the Internet is a =
very compelling one and the development of personal home speaker =
assistants is likely to strongly benefit of cutting-edge research =
developments in speech recognition, especially with the recent advent of =
Deep Learning techniques. Such advancements in voice biometrics and =
voice authentication will help ease privacy concerns and make the =
devices more adaptable to multi-user environments. The Home- Keeper =
project falls within that line of research and aims at developing an =
innovative intelligent home speaker connected to a service platform, and =
will rely on Artificial Intelligence and vocal interaction to ensure =
secure access to the services.

Objectives and challenges:=20
---------------------------
Several bottlenecks will have to be overpassed in order to perform the =
speaker identification. The first one will consists in defining a deep =
learning architecture sufficiently generic for the framework of the =
application. The second challenge will consists to deal with the re- =
duced number of available data. This problem is particularly challenging =
in the deep learning context which usually require huge mass of data in =
order to perform an accurate learning. The insight of the project will =
be focused on these two points, the second one being hardly addressed by =
the literature.

Work plan:
-----------
The position will start by a large state of the art and an encoding of =
the best non deep methods. This first step should take 3 months and will =
allow to provide a first result to the other partners of the project.
The second step, evaluated to 6 months will consists in designing a deep =
learning architecture and to train it in order to identify several =
members of the project.
The last step, evaluated to 3 month, will consists in designing a first =
functional prototype and to evaluate its performances (in terms of size =
of the training set, precision and recall) when a deep network is =
trained on a new set of persons. This new training will be performed =
either thanks to random weighs or thanks to the weighs obtained at the =
previous step. The network architecture will remain unchanged.

Candidate profile:=20
------------------
The candidate must have a recent Ph.D. (within 5 years) in Computer =
Science (or Applied Mathematics) in the filed of Machine Learning. =
Knowledge and experience within the Deep Learning frameworks is also =
very welcomed. The candidate will perform research and algorithmic =
development and solid programming skills are required. Excellent =
interpersonal skills and the ability to work well individually or as a =
member of a project team are recommended. Good written and verbal =
communication skills are required, the candidate has to be fluent in =
spoken French or English and written English. Working language can be =
English or French.

Location:
-----------
Caen, France in the GREYC UMR CNRS laboratory. Situated in the Normandy =
region of France close to the sea and about 240km west of Paris; the =
city still has many old quarters, a population of around 120,000; the =
city area has roughly 250,000 inhabitants.

Application:
-------------
Interested candidates should submit their application to =
luc.brun@ensicaen.fr and olivier.lezoray@unicaen.fr
Please include in your application email one Curriculum Vitae, one =
statement of research letter ex- plaining your interest and your skills =
for this position, and 2 reference letters (all in a single pdf file). =
Applications will be admitted until the position is filled.

Additional information:
-----------------------
Host institution: University of Caen Normandy and CNRS, GREYC laboratory =

Gross Salary: 2074 euros per month (charges included)
Duration: One year, expendable to 18 months
Starting date: from January/February 2018
Advantages: Possibility of French courses, participation in transport =
costs, possibility of restoration on site.
