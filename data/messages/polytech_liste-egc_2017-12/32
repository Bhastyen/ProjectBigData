Overview
* * * * * * *=20

The ESWC organizers are glad to announce that the Challenges Track will =
be included again in the program of ESWC 2018. Five challenges were held =
last year [1] and allowed the ESWC2017 conference to attract a broader =
audience beyond the Semantic Web community, also spanning across =
disciplines such as Recommender Systems or Knowledge Extraction.=20

For the 2018 edition, a call for challenges is open in order to allow =
the selection of challenges to be held at the conference. The purpose of =
challenges is to showcase the maturity of state of the art methods and =
tools on tasks common to the Semantic Web community and adjacent =
disciplines, in a controlled setting involving rigorous evaluation.
Semantic Web Challenges are an official track of the conference, =
ensuring significant visibility for the challenges as well as =
participants. Challenge participants are asked to present their =
submissions as well as provide a paper describing their work.  These =
papers must undergo a peer-review by experts relevant to the challenge =
task, and will be published in the challenge proceedings.
Next to the publication of proceedings, challenges at ESWC2018 will =
benefit from high visibility and direct access to the ESWC audience and =
community.

Challenge Proposals
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Challenge organizers are encouraged to submit proposals adhering to the =
following criteria:

- At least one task involving semantics in data.=20
The task(s) should be well defined and related to the Semantic Web but =
not necessarily confined to it. It is highly encouraged to consider =
tasks which involve other, highly related communities, such as NLP, =
Recommender Systems, Machine Learning or Information Retrieval. If =
multiple tasks are provided the tasks should be independent so that =
participants may choose which to participate in.

- Task descriptions are likely to be interesting to a wider audience.=20
We encourage the challenge organizers to propose at least one basic task =
that can be addressed by a larger audience from their community. =
Engaging with your challenge audience and obtaining feedback from your =
target group on the task design might be helpful for shaping the task =
and ensuring sufficient number of participants.

- Clear and rigorous definition of the tasks.=20
For each task, you should define a deterministic and objective way to =
verify if the goal of the task has been achieved, and to which extent it =
has been achieved (if applicable). The best way is usually to provide =
detailed examples of input data and expected output. The examples must =
cover all the possible situations that can occur while performing the =
task, and should leave no place to ambiguity about whether in a =
particular case the task is done or not.

- Valid dataset (if applicable).=20
If accepted, you should find or create a dataset that will be used for =
the challenge. In any case, you must specify the provenance of the =
dataset (if it contains human annotation =E2=80=93 how were those =
obtained). You must make sure you have the right to use/publish this =
dataset and clearly state the license for its use within the challenge. =
The dataset should be split at least in two parts =E2=80=93 the training =
part, and the evaluation part. The training part contains the data, and =
the results that should be obtained when performing the task. As for the =
evaluation part, you should only publish the data, and make sure that =
the correct results have not previously been available to the =
participants. When proposing the challenge you must provide details on =
the dataset and on the way it is/will be created =E2=80=93 the dataset =
can be made available later.

- Challenge Committee.=20
Composed of at least 3 respected researchers with experience in the =
tasks of the challenge. They help evaluate the papers submitted by the =
participants, and also validate the evaluation procedure.

- Evaluation metrics and procedure. For each task there must be at least =
two objective criteria (metrics) (e.g. precision and recall). The =
evaluation procedure and the way in which the metrics will be calculated =
must be clearly specified and made transparent to participants (having =
in the website of the challenge evaluation scripts available for =
participants would be a good practice to use).
Among the selection criteria for choosing the supported challenges are:
-- Potential number to interested participants
-- Rigor and transparency of the evaluation procedure
-- Relevance for the Semantic Web community
-- Endorsements (from researchers working on the task, from industry =
players interested in results, from future participants)
