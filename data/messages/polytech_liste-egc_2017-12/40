special cross-disciplinary session on

“Interactive/Multiple Clustering using Evolutionary Computation,Fuzzy, 
Machine Learning and/or Neural Networks” at

                                                 IEEE World Congress on 
Computational Intelligence

                                                 08-13 July 2018, 
Windsor Convention Centre, Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL

http://www.ecomp.poli.br/~wcci2018/ <http://www.ecomp.poli.br/%7Ewcci2018/>


Organized by Marcilio de Souto (University of Orleans, France), Andre de 
Carvalho (University of São Paulo, Brazil), Christel Vrain
(University of Orleans, France), and Guillaume Cleuziou (University of 
Orleans, France)

Clustering is a well-studied domain. Currently, more and more data are 
collected from multiple sources or represented by multiple views
(e.g., text, video, images, biological data, among others). Also, for 
the same data there might exist several different structures 
(clusterings) which are meaningful for the user. In this context, 
clustering techniques are often required to be able to provide several 
possibilities for analyzing the data. As a consequence, in recent years, 
the interdisciplinary research topic on multiple clusterings has drawn 
significant attention of the data mining community.

Another topic of recent interest in clustering is interactive 
clustering. For instance, usually clustering is studied in the 
unsupervised learning framework. However, as pointed out in some 
studies, in several real-world problems, such as personalized 
recommendations, it is not possible to reach the “optimal” clustering 
(the solution that meets the requirements of the user) without 
interacting with the end user. In order to approach this problem, 
recently frameworks for interactive clustering with human in the loop 
have been proposed. These algorithms can interact with the human in 
steps and receive feedback to improve.

The aim of this special session is to bring together researchers from 
Machine Learning and Data Mining which are actively working in the 
fields of multiple clusterings and interactive clustering. The idea is 
to cover a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from multi-view clustering, 
the interaction with human supervisors to constraint-based clustering, 
and stimulate cross-fertilization. In this context, as it is a 
cross-disciplinary session, we welcome papers in which techniques such 
machine learning, neural networks, fuzzy systems and evolutionary 
computing are used in the context of Interactive/Multiple Clustering.

In particular, we welcome contributions that address aspects including, 
but not limited to:

·      Cluster ensemble and   Multi-view clustering:
·       How to combine/merge different clustering, how to control/force 
the disagreement/diversity between distinct clusterings,  how to choose 
a solution among too many possible ones, how to represent/visualize a 
set of solutions.
·      Multi-objective clustering.
·      Multiple clustering solutions from very high dimensional and 
complex databases.
·      Constraint-based clustering and applications as, for instance, 
alternative clustering.
·      New approaches to interactive clustering
·      Methodologies for the evaluation of interactive clustering, and 
comparative studies.
