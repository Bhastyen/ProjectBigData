Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: 2018 Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop
 (PKAW 2018)


2018 Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW 2018)
		http://www.pkaw.org

Welcome to the 2018 Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW
2018) to be held at China on August 27-28, 2018. Over the past two
decades, PKAW has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners
working in the area of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence
(MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI).

PKAW 2018 will be held as part of the 15th Pacific Rim International
Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2018). The purpose of
this workshop is to provide a chance for intensive discussion on the
aspects of knowledge acquisition and AI.  According to the Gartner
Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2017, AI is one of the top
emerging technology mega-trends. Artificial intelligence is changing
the way in which organizations innovate and communicate their
processes, products and services.

In recent years, unprecedented data, called big data, has become
available and knowledge acquisition and learning from big data is
increasing in importance. Various knowledge can be acquired not only
from human experts but also from diverse data. Simultaneous
acquisition from both data and human experts increases its
importance. Multidisciplinary research including knowledge
engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, human
computer interaction, and artificial intelligence are required. We
invite authors to submit papers on all aspects of these area.

Another important and related area is applications. Not only in the
engineering field but also in the social science field (e.g.,
economics, social networks, and sociology), recent progress of
knowledge acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing
interesting applications. We also invite submissions that present
applications tested and deployed in real-life settings. Those papers
should address lessons learned from application development and
deployment.

All papers will be peer reviewed, and those accepted for the workshop
will be included in the Springer LNAI proceedings.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Papers are invited for consideration in all aspects of knowledge
acquisition, engineering and management for intelligent systems,
including (but not restricted to):
   - Fundamental views on knowledge that affect the knowledge acquisition process and the use of knowledge in knowledge engineering
   - Algorithmic approaches to knowledge acquisition
   - Tools and techniques for knowledge acquisition, knowledge maintenance and knowledge validation
   - Evaluation of knowledge acquisition techniques, tools and methods
   - Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modelling information systems or decision support systems
   - Methods and techniques for sharing and reusing knowledge
   - Ontology and its role in knowledge acquisition
   - Mining the Semantic Web, the Linked Data and the Web of Data
   - Hybrid approaches combining knowledge engineering and machine learning
   - Innovative user interfaces
   - Big data capture, representation and analytics
   - Crowd-sourcing for data generation and problem solving
   - Software engineering and knowledge engineering
   - Algorithms, tools and techniques for machine intelligence
   - Knowledge acquisition applications tested and deployed in in real-life settings
   -
PAPER FORMAT AND LENGTH
Papers must follow the Springer Lecture Notes format. The paper should
be between 10 to 15 pages long. For format templates, please see the
Springer.
