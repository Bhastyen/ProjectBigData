Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: BPM 2018 (16th International Conference on
 Business Process Management)

---------------------------

BPM 2018 - 16th International Conference on Business Process Management
Call for Papers


September 9-14, 2018, Sydney, Australia.

http://bpm2018.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/

---------------------------


The annual BPM conference is the premium forum for researchers and 
practitioners in business process management. BPM is a broad discipline, 
covering topics that range from formal methods in computer science to 
techniques in information systems engineering, to management science 
methods. Therefore, not only different research topics are addressed, 
but also different research methods are employed that require different 
evaluation criteria in the peer reviewing process.

To accommodate for this diversity, the BPM conference introduces a new 
structure. This structure is based on three tracks that cover not only 
different phenomena of interest and research methods but, consequently, 
also different evaluation criteria. To implement this structure, each 
track has a dedicated track chair and a dedicated program committee. The 
track chairs, together with a consolidation chair, are responsible for 
the scientific program. Through this new structure we aim to broaden the 
BPM community and position the BPM conference as a forum for all aspects 
of the broad business process management discipline.


TRACK I: FOUNDATIONS

Track I invites papers that follow computer science research methods. 
This includes papers that investigate the underlying principles of BPM 
systems, computational theories, algorithms, and methods for modeling 
and analyzing business processes. This track also covers papers on novel 
languages, architectures, and other concepts underlying process aware 
information systems, as well as papers that use conceptual modeling 
techniques to investigate problems in the design and analysis of BPM 
systems. Papers in Track I are evaluated according to computer science 
standards, including sound formalization, convincing argumentation, and, 
where applicable, proof of concept implementation, which shows that the 
concepts can be implemented as described. Since papers typically do not 
have an immediate application in concrete business environments, 
empirical evaluation does not play a major role in Track I.


You should send your paper to Track I if:

- It provides foundational results about the underlying principles and 
concepts of BPM systems.
- It advances the state of the art in BPM through the investigation of 
formal methods and algorithms.
- It contributes to the definition of novel concepts, languages, and 
architectures for BPM systems.
- It tackles conceptual modelling issues of BPM systems and their 
environment.
- It investigates novel concepts of BPM systems through the development 
of proof-of-concept implementations.


Track Chair: Marco Montali

Senior PC: Florian Daniel, Dirk Fahland, Giancarlo Guizzardi, Thomas 
Hildebrandt, Marcello La Rosa, John Mylopoulos, Manfred Reichert, 
Jianwen Su, Hagen Völzer, Matthias Weidlich.


TRACK II: ENGINEERING

Track II invites papers that follow information systems engineering 
methods. The focus is on the investigation of artifacts and systems in 
business environments, following the design science approach. Papers in 
this track are expected to have a strong empirical evaluation that 
critically tests criteria like usefulness or added value of the proposed 
artifact. This track covers business process intelligence, including 
process mining techniques, and the use of process models for enactment, 
model-driven engineering, as well as interaction with services and 
deployment architectures like the Cloud. It also covers BPM systems in 
particular domains, such as digital health, smart mobility, or Internet 
of Things. Empirical evaluations are important to show the merits of the 
artifact introduced. A self-critical discussion of threats to validity 
is expected. Formalization of problems and solutions should be used 
where they add clarity or are beneficial in other ways.

You should send your paper to Track II if:
- It has a significant technical contribution.
- Its results are empirically evaluated.
- It reports on a system that you designed, with a maturity of at least 
a prototype. i.e., it can be evaluated in an application context.
- It follows the design science approach.

Track Chair: Ingo Weber

Senior PC: Wil van der Aalst, Boualem Benatallah, Boudewijn van Dongen, 
Jan Mendling, Cesare Pautasso, Hajo Reijers, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Pnina 
Soffer, Barbara Weber, Jianmin Wang


TRACK III: MANAGEMENT

Track III invites papers that aim at advancing our understanding of how 
BPM can deliver business value, for instance how it builds 
organizational capabilities to improve, innovate or transform the 
respective business. Papers that study the application and impact of BPM 
methods and tools in use contexts based on empirical observation are 
highly welcome.

Areas of interest include a wide range of capability areas that are 
relevant for BPM, such as strategic alignment, governance, methods, 
information technology, and human aspects including people and culture. 
We seek contributions that advance our understanding on how 
organizations can develop such capabilities in order to achieve specific 
objectives in given organizational contexts. Papers may use various 
strategies of inquiry, including case study research, action research, 
focus group research, big data analytics research, neuroscience 
research, econometric research, literature review research, survey 
research or design science research. Papers will be evaluated according 
to management and information systems standards.

Authors of selected papers in this track will be invited to submit 
revised and extended versions of their work for a special issue in the 
European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS) on “Business Process 
Management and Digital Innovation”.

You should send your paper to Track III if:
- It makes a contribution to an organizational challenge.
- It builds on and draws from real-world organizational endeavors in BPM.
- It extends the BPM body of knowledge to better contribute to strategy 
delivery.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Each paper will be submitted to exactly one track. Please use the track 
descriptions above to decide where to send your paper. Authors may 
contact track chairs for clarification. Papers must be formatted 
according to Springer's LNCS formatting guidelines. Submissions must be 
in English and must not exceed 16 pages. The title page must contain a 
short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics 
above. The paper must clearly state the problem being addressed, the 
goal of the work, the results achieved, and the relation to other work. 
Student papers are treated as regular papers in the review process. 
Importantly, the contribution underlying a student paper must be carried 
out mainly by the student(s), but others (advisors, collaborators, etc.) 
can appear as authors as well. When submitting the paper, student papers 
must be clearly marked as such in the EasyChair system. To be eligible 
for the best student paper award, student papers have to be presented at 
the conference by a student author.


Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the BPM 2018 
EasyChair submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2018.

Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been 
published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals 
while being submitted to BPM 2018. Authors are encouraged to adhere to 
the best practices of Reproducible Research (RR), by making available 
data and software tools for reproducing the results reported in their 
papers.

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published 
by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. For each 
accepted paper, at least one author must register for the conference and 
present the paper. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit 
an extended version to special issues in Elsevier’s Information Systems 
(Tracks I and II) and in Palgrave’s European Journal of Information 
Systems (Track III).

The BPM Forum will host innovative research which has high potential of 
stimulating discussion at the conference but does not fully meet the 
quality criteria for the main conference. Those papers will be invited 
to the BPM Forum and published in full length in a separate 
post-proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Business Information 
Processing series, as well as being presented during the main 
conference. There will not be short papers at the conference.

First-time submitters to BPM may request to be considered for a 
pre-submission shepherding program in which a selected BPM PC member 
advises on the presentation and positioning of a shepherded paper. 
Interested candidates are encouraged to contact the PC Chairs 
(bpm2018@easychair.org) by 23 January, 2018.
