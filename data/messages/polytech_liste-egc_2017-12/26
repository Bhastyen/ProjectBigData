*Call for Papers*

The Database community has increasingly become interested in the 
Semantic Web, and the two communities have enjoyed a joint growth in the 
past few years. We are witnessing an increase in the amount of 
structured data published online, such as HTML or XML tables, linked 
data as RDF or JSON-LD collections, embedded microformats, social 
graphs, and smart sensors. Semantifying, publishing, curating and 
managing such types of data in terms of entities and properties has been 
incorporated in a variety of research and commercial projects and 
settings, that involve, among others, web content harvesting, knowledge 
representation, knowledge extraction and enrichment, record and entity 
linkage, and searching, reasoning and analyzing structured web data and 
social data.

Furthermore, RDF triple stores and SPARQL query engines have attracted 
increasing interest from database researchers that has led to novel 
algorithms, methods and techniques for issues such as query optimization 
and efficient storage of huge data sizes and workloads. This field has 
also seen advances in distributed and cloud query processing on large 
scale datasets using MapReduce, and at the same time relational support 
of RDF and SPARQL has become more efficient. This allows for the 
application of existing and well-established relational techniques on 
semantic web contexts. Moreover, commercial interest in semantic web 
data has been shown by major companies and projects such as Google’s 
Knowledge Graph, Facebook’s Open Graph, BestBuy, BBC and Thomson Reuters.

While these indications show that the vision of the semantic web has 
become an established reality through a series of decade-long 
methodological advances, the community is shifting its attention to 
applying scaling methods for handling and managing very large 
collections of data and workloads. Issues such as query optimization, 
storage, query processing, record linkage, and semantic disambiguation 
and grounding form excellent candidates for scalable algorithms and 
methods of data management in the context of Big Data. Moreover, the 
proliferation of online social networks and media has brought to light 
new challenges for semantic technologies due to their large-scale, 
noisy, and real-time nature. These challenges can benefit from the 
expertise and insight of the database community that traditionally has 
experience handling similar issues.

DESWeb is focused on providing a forum that brings together these two 
separate communities, by highlighting their common interests and 
promoting mutual advancement and cross-fertilization. Given the recent 
explosion of structured data available on the Web and associated 
challenges with respect to what is commonly referred to as the 3V’s 
(Volume, Variety and Velocity) the workshop’s aim is more timely than ever.

The DESWEB workshop calls for short papers (of up to 6 pages, IEEE 
format) on research results and ongoing projects in the conjunction of 
these thematic areas. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

  *

    Ontologies and data integration

  *

    Semantic search

  *

    Semantic grounding of raw data

  *

    Linked Data, including Privacy in Linked Data and its impact on data
    management

  *

    Reasoning over Web data and services

  *

    Semantic authoring and crowdsourcing

  *

    Semantic recommender systems

  *

    Generation and aggregation of social semantics

  *

    Ontologies and data models for social data representation and analysis

  *

    Social semantic recommendations

  *

    Distributed query processing and optimization

  *

    Data quality, profiling, and uncertainty

  *

    Data mining and knowledge discovery

  *

    Data provenance and trust

  *

    Data versioning, evolution, change detection and representation

  *

    Innovative use of semantic technologies (e.g., on scientific,
    healthcare, environmental, e-government data etc.)

and all other topics at the crossroads of Semantic Web and Data 
Engineering research.

We also encourage the submission of papers on visions and challenges, 
focusing on radical and novel ideas rather than established approaches, 
as well as difficult and open problems rather than solutions.
