The First International Workshop on Smart Sensing Systems (IWSSS '16)
Hiroshima, Japan
November 28, 2016

in conjunction with MobiQuitous 2016  In cooperation with Smart Sensing
Systems Group, the Society of Instrument and Control System (SICE)

CALL FOR PAPERS

During the past years, sensing technologies have become an important field
for computer science and technologies as seen in the trend of cyber
physical system (CPS), machine-to-machine (M2M) systems, and the Internet
of Things (IoT). Researchers in sensing technologies provide technological
means to capture environmental, technical, physiological and other data.
They provide the raw material on which applications and services will be
built. Sensor data are the basis for the smart world. Due to various
characteristics of sensor data and their corresponding processing
requirements, such as multi-source, heterogeneous, real-time, voluminous,
continuous, streaming, ever-expanding and spatio-temporal, many traditional
data processing and integration approaches begin to show their limitations,
particularly when dealing with situations like sensor data and its
application deluge.

Streaming data analysis, knowledge extraction (data mining, machine
learning) and complex event processing are required to treat and
pre-process these data, to detect correlations in data and to discover
patterns or abnormalities in dynamically evolving situations. Data files as
well as data streams need to be treated, variety of representation are used
depending on the Web-based systems and the means for handling, storing and
accessing this information to make valuable decisions need to be studied.
Semantic web technologies have provided particle means to this aim. Social
applications, and ubiquitous and pervasive computing are examples of areas
making use of semantised sensed or processed data. Semantisation, privacy,
trust, context awareness, community management, and data visualization are
the core issues related to this area. We aim to find bring together topics
from several layers of data processing; from devices to services to enable
novel ideas and collaboration combining the information from multiple
sources.

The workshop intends to provide a forum for exchange of experiences among
researchers from industry and academia actively involved in research,
development and evaluation of new concepts, theoretical methods and
experimental characterization and for debating different innovative
solutions. Practitioners involved in applications domains are also welcome
to present their tasks and to participate to these discussions. The
workshop will feature a selective technical program consisting of regular
research papers as well as position talks. This workshop is continuation of
International Workshop of Web Intelligence and Smart Sensing Systems
(IWWISS). The name of the workshop is changed to focus more on system
aspects.  We invite authors to submit original research as well as review
articles, posters and demos to present latest progresses, determine future
goals, and show techniques for future development in the field.
