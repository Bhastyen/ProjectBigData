Utilizing Big Data Paradigms for Business Intelligence=20

A book edited by Jerome Darmont and Sabine Loudcher (Universit=C3=A9 de Lyo=
n, Lyon 2, ERIC EA3083, France)=20

http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/bdbibook/=20


* Introduction=20

Business intelligence (BI) aims to support decisions, not only in the busin=
ess area stricto sensu, but also in the domains of health, environment, ene=
rgy, transportation, science, etc. It provides a transverse vision of an or=
ganization's data and allows accessing quickly and simply to strategic info=
rmation. For this sake, data must be extracted, grouped, organized, aggrega=
ted and correlated with methods and techniques such as data integration (ET=
L), data warehousing, online analytical processing (OLAP), reporting, data =
mining and machine learning. BI is nowadays casually used both in large com=
panies and organizations, and small and middle-sized entreprises, thanks to=
 the advent of cloud computing and cheap BI-as-a-service. The development o=
f BI in the 1990's has also sparkled vivid research that currently addresse=
s new challenges in big data.=20


* Objective of the Book=20

Mashing up internal and external data is acknowledged as the best way to pr=
ovide the most complete view for decision making. Yet, tackling data hetero=
geneity has always been an issue. With big data coming into play, benefits =
from processing external data look even better, but issues are also more co=
mplex. Data volume challenges even warehouses that were tailored for large =
amounts of data. Velocity challenges the very idea of materializing histori=
cized data. Variety and veracity issues remain, but at a much greater exten=
t. Finally, actually extracting intelligible information from big data (dat=
a value) requires novel methods. Finally, new technologies such as cloud co=
mputing, Hadoop/Spark and NoSQL databases also question classical BI.=20

This book plans to gather top-level research contributions addressing probl=
ems related to the five "Vs" of big data, technological issues, as well as =
big data analytics applications. Contributions will be reviewed by an inter=
national scientific committee.=20


* Target Audience=20

The target audience of this book will be composed of=20
- researchers=20
- practitioners from the industry=20
- graduate students in the fields of computer science, data science and bus=
iness intelligence.=20

ance optimization, NoSQL storage=20

- Data velocity issues: cloud/parallel processing for analytics...=20
- Data veracity issues: data quality, data security (privacy, integrity...)=
,=20
- Data value issues: data visualization, data storytelling, personalization=
, recommendation, collaborative analyses...=20
- Applications: Internet of Things & BI, Textual Documents Analytics, Socia=
l Media Analytics, Real-time analytics, Self-service BI, Smart cities & BI,=

idelines. Full chapters of about 10,000 words are expected to be submitted =
