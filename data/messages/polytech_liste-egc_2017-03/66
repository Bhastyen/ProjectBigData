In numerous applications, data are not in a vectorial form but are =
rather structured: they are described by a set of parts that have =
relationships or constraints between them. For instance, an image can be =
represented at different scales by a hierarchical representation; time =
series have an intrinsic internal structure that must be taken into =
account. A consequence of the presence of structure in the data is that =
the classical machine learning techniques can not be directly applied. =
Two solutions are usually implemented to solve this problem:=20
i) data are first transformed in order to bring back to a vectorial form =
(e.g. thanks to a feature extraction step in the time series context  or =
by stacking all the nodes attributes when dealing with a tree). =
Nevertheless, providing meaningful features is not straightforward;
ii) similarity measures between the different subparts are computed, =
then combined together (thanks to a convolutional kernel for instance. =
It usually suffers from high computational costs, preventing the method =
to be used in a large scale context.
In both cases, the solution is problem dependent, depending on the type =
of the structure, the type of features etc.
In the meantime, optimal transport (OT)  has emerged as a powerful tool =
to compute distances(a.k.a. Wasserstein or earth mover's distances) =
between empirical distribution of data, thanks to new computational =
schemes that make the transport computation tractable. It has wide =
applications in computer vision, statistics, imaging and has been =
recently introduced in the machine learning community to efficiently =
solve classification or transfer learning problems. The advantage of OT =
is that it can compare possibly high dimensional empirical probability =
measures, taking into account the geometry of the underlying metric =
spaces and dealing with discrete measures.

The objective of the PhD is to define a new unified paradigm for =
classification of structured data by leveraging on the theory of optimal =
transport. Two directions will be explored:
i) integration of the information carried out by the structure directly =
in the OT problem. In particular,  the lead of defining a dedicated =
regularization term shall be explored;
ii) integration fo the structure directly inside the distance matrix =
between the data, building  upon  the  notion of  Gromov-Wasserstein  =
distances for instance.
The aim is to produce an unified framework for many types of structured =
data, integrating problem specificities within the shape of the =
regularization or distances. A particular emphasis will be put on the =
developpement of efficient solutions, able to deal with large datasets.
=46rom an application point of view, a particular attention will be =
given on remote sensing datasets. Indeed, hierarchical representations =
are more and more used to model the content of an image, providing an =
effective framework for image classification. In addition, with the =
launch of new satellites, spatial and temporal resolution of remote =
sensing images has considerably increased, thus calling for the =
development of efficient algorithms.

The OBELIX Team is a team   from Irisa (http://www.irisa.fr/) =
<http://www.irisa.fr/%29>. The team is dedicated to environment =
observation problems, implying advanced image processing techniques and =
machine learning. The team is co-located between Rennes and Vannes, two =
beautiful cities from Brittany, France.=20
