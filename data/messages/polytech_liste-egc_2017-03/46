Subject: [liste-egc] IJCRS2017 special session on FCA and Rough set:
 submission due 28th March

Dear colleagues,=20

IJCRS2017 organizers are pleased to inform that due to a large
influx of submissions, the submission deadline is now March 28 midnight =
Greenwich time!

This applies also for the special track session on Formal Concept =
Analysis, Rough Set Theory and Their
Applications, so you have a bit more time to submit your work!

Updated info on: =
http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=3D61624

With our best regards,
Jaume Baixeries, Dmitry Ignatov, Mehdi Kaytoue and Sergei O. Kuznetsov=20=

>=20
>=20
> Objectives
> Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory
> aimed at applications in data analysis and knowledge discovery. FCA
> allows one to build a concept lattice and dependencies of different
> kinds (rules, implications, etc.) for input data in both supervised
> and unsupervised forms. This machinery can be be used for many
> purposes, e.g. learning from data, biclustering, knowledge
> representation, reasoning, ontology engineering, information
> retrieval, recommendation, and text processing.
>=20
> On the one hand FCA provides operationalisation of objects similarity
> in terms of their common attributes (or common descriptions), on the
> other hand Rough Set Theory studies their discernibility and provides
> convenient means for approximation, which are complementary, in a
> certain sense, to fuzzy concepts. Accordingly, there are many links
> between FCA and Rough Set Theory that can be found in data analysis,
> pattern mining, fuzzy sets theory, database theory, algebraic
> representation, logic systems, reasoning systems, etc.
>=20
> Recent years have shown an increased activity in FCA, in particular in
> extending FCA to different formalisms: pattern
> structures, database representation, fuzzy FCA, relational FCA,
> polyadic concepts, etc. These extensions allow FCA to deal with more
> complex than just binary object-attribute data (e.g. RDF data, rating
> matrices, sequences and graphs), for data analysis, knowledge
> discovery and knowledge engineering.
> Therefore, this special session will be interested in issues such as:
>=20
> - Relationship between FCA and Rough Set Theory, fuzzy closure
> systems, fuzzy orders.
> - RS/FCA algorithms for Big Data
> - RS/FCA algorithms for complex data
> - How can existing FCA algorithms help RS and vice versa? - RS/FCA for
> Knowledge Discovery and Pattern Mining
> - RS/FCA for Knowledge Engineering and Representation
> - Bireducts and biclusters
> - Rule-based approaches in RS/FCA
> - Multi-way extensions of RS/FCA
>=20
> Topics of interest.
>=20
> The main topics include, but not limited to:
>=20
> - Foundations of FCA and RS
> - Scalable algorithms in FCA and RS for Big Data.
> - Applications of FCA and RS in complex data: text mining,
> classification and mining in web of data, information retrieval,
> recommendation, visualization and navigation.
