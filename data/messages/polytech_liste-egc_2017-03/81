                     CALL FOR PAPERS

         The Sixteenth International Symposium on
           Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2017)

      October 26 - October 28, 2017, London, United Kingdom
        Paper submission deadline:  19 May 2017

                    www.ida2017.org

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

--- FOCUS ---

The traditional focus of the IDA symposium series is on end-to-end intelligent support for data analysis. In 2010, the series re-focused to support papers that go beyond established technology and offer genuinely novel and "game-changing" ideas.

The symposium aims to provide a forum for inspiring research contributions that might be considered preliminary in other leading conferences and journals, but that have a potentially dramatic impact. To facilitate this, IDA 2017 will feature two tracks: a regular "Proceedings" track, as well as a "Horizon" track for early-stage research of potentially ground-breaking nature. Submissions to this latter track will not be published in the proceedings, to allow authors to present their most adventurous and controversial research ideas without running the risk of compromising any subsequent publications.

The IDA symposium, which is A-ranked according to ERA, is open to all kinds of modeling and analysis methods, irrespective of discipline. It is expected to be an interdisciplinary meeting that seeks abstractions that cut across domains.

--- KEYNOTE SPEAKERS ---

Along with the contributed presentations, the symposium schedule will feature three exciting keynote talks by renowned researchers:

- Prof. Paul Cohen (University of Arizona, Tucson, USA)
  	"Mining for Causal Results"

- Dr. Niels Beek (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK)
	"Opportunities and Challenges of Learning Health Systems"

- Dr. A. Aldo Faisal (Imperial College London, London, UK)
	TBA

--- CALL FOR PAPERS ---

IDA solicits papers on all aspects of intelligent data analysis, including papers on intelligent techniques to modeling and analyzing data from complex, dynamical systems. IDA 2017 particularly encourages innovative papers about:

   - Applications of IDA techniques to complex systems
   - Concepts and principles for the analysis of complex, inter-linked, and heterogeneous data
   - Human-computer interaction and cooperation for data analysis
   - The interplay between data analysis and visualization
   - Robustness and scalability issues of intelligent data analysis
     techniques

The conventional reviewing process has a tendency to favor low risk incremental contributions over inspiring high risk contributions. This can discourage the kind of papers that IDA hopes to publish. For this reason, similar to IDA 2016, IDA 2017 will have two paper tracks, the combination of which addresses this issue.

[A] Proceedings Track

Papers submitted to this track will be reviewed and, if accepted, published in the proceedings. Submitted papers should consist of at most 11 pages in LNCS format. Papers may be accepted for either oral or poster presentation.

To ensure that the papers sought by IDA get accepted, referees will evaluate papers against the stated goals of the symposium, and if at least one program chair advisor writes an informed, thoughtful, positive review for a paper, this may outweigh criticisms of other reviewers.

We strongly encourage all authors to upload their Proceedings track submission onto a preprint server, such as arxiv, prior to submission. After acceptance, uploading your paper onto a preprint server will no longer be optional but mandatory, and we will require all authors to do this by the camera-ready deadline.

Following IDA's tradition, the proceedings of IDA 2017 will be published as a volume in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

[B] Horizon Track

The Horizon track aims to provide a forum for potentially ground-breaking research that is however not yet mature enough for archival dissemination. You may have a great idea that needs to be investigated in more detail, or you may have a long-term vision that you would like to share. In these cases, it may be impossible or undesirable to publish a preliminary version of your paper in the proceedings, but presenting and discussing it at IDA may be of interest to both you and the community.

To be considered for a Horizon Track presentation, you are required to submit a title and a short abstract (<250 words) and optionally any other material, e.g.  an extended abstract, a partial manuscript, a presentation, a movie or a link to a website, that may help us to review the submission against the stated criteria. Titles and abstracts of contributions accepted for the Horizon track will be listed on the symposium website and included in the proceedings front matter, but any other material submitted will be used for reviewing only, and will not be publicly divulged in any form.  Horizon Track contributions may be accepted for either oral or poster presentation.

--- IMPORTANT DATES ---

Paper submission deadline: 19 May 2017
Author notification:       14 July 2017
Camera ready:              14 August 2017
Symposium:                 26-28 October 2017
