Subject: [liste-egc] PhD Scholarship on Concurrent Speech Interface for
 Visually Impaired People - Normandy University - FRANCE (Deadline
 Extension)

                          PhD Scholarship

       Concurrent Speech Interface for Visually Impaired People

     Normandy University / CNRS GREYC UMR 6072 Laboratory / FRANCE

           Application deadline: 30.03.2017 (11:59 pm GMT)
#####################################################################

The Human Language Technology Team (HULTECH) of the CNRS GREYC
Laboratory at the Normandy University (France) seeks to hire an
excellent PhD candidate to work on non-visual access to digital
documents based on concurrent speech and summarization techniques.

Visual browsing on the Internet provides access to both an early and
global view of a web page (skimming) and then allows an active and fast
search of specific information (scanning). In both cases, the typography
and the lay out of the elements in the document are of crucial
importance. In non-Visual browsing, such information is usually lost and
as a consequence, skimming and scanning are difficult actions to be
endeavored by blind users. Although palliative systems such as speeding
up speech synthesis, skipping titles or hypertext links, or reading the
first or last sentences of all the paragraphs have been proposed, the
difference in effectiveness compared to Visual navigation remains
significant.
Within this thesis, we are interested in the design of non-linear
skimming and scanning strategies adapted to non-Visual navigation in
order to improve the accessibility to information for blind users (fast
or diagonal reading). More details on the proposed solution and the
specific areas addressed can be found at the following url (French
Language):
https://www.greyc.fr/sites/default/files/secretariat/theses-2017/Sujet_These_Hultech_FerrariMaurelDias_2017.pdf.

The candidate should hold a Master degree (or equivalent) in Computer
Science or a comparable field. Theoretical and practical experiences in
Natural Language Processing, Human Computer Interaction, Speech
Synthesis, Machine Learning and/or Information Retrieval would be
appreciated. The successful candidate should show ability to work in a
collaborative multi-disciplinary environment and evidence strong
programming skills. Oral and written proficiency in French would be a plus.

The full-time position will start on 1st September 2017 for a 3-years
duration. The student will work at the CNRS GREYC Laboratory at the
Normandy University in the city of Caen (France) for a net salary of
1300 EUR per month. Tuition fees are covered by the scholarship.

To apply to this position, please send a detailed CV including a
statement of interest and at least two recommendation letters. The
applicant must also attach his/her Bachelor and Master Certificates
together with the detailed lists of marks or grades. The candidate may
include a list of any publications, certificates or other qualifications
(if any) considered relevant for assessing his/her abilities in relation
to this call. Emails should have the reference code PhD-HULTECH-2017 and
should be sent to the supervisors Fabrice Maurel
(fabrice.maurel@unicaen.fr), Stéphane Ferrari
(stephane.ferrari@unicaen.fr) and Gaël Dias (gael.dias@unicaen.fr). The
application deadline is 30.03.2017 (11:59 pm GMT) and only applications
received before the aforementioned deadline will be considered.

For further information, please contact directly the supervisors.
