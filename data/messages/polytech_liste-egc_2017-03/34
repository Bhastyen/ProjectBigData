*CALL FOR PAPERS - WIMS’17 7th ACM International Conference on Web 
Intelligence, Mining and Semantics Amantea, Italy, 19-22 June 2017 **http://www.units.it/cuzzocrea/confs/WIMS2017/*


About WIMS’17 Conference
------------------------
WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science conferences. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present their state-of-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to examine performance characteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent information technology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas on the development of Web-based intelligent information management solutions across different domains.

Invited Speakers
----------------
Prof. Maurizio Lenzerini, University “La Sapienza”, Italy
Prof. Oscar Pastor, Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain

Objectives
----------
The purpose of the WIMS series is:

- To provide a forum for established researchers and practitioners to present their contributions to the state of the art research and development in Web technology and applications.
- To give doctoral students an opportunity to present their research to a friendly and knowledgeable audience and receive valuable feedback.
- To provide an informal social event where Web technology researchers and practitioners can meet.

WIMS traditionally hosts a small number of short tutorials on the topics related to the scope of the conference series. The role of a WIMS tutorial is to be a theme-oriented comprehensive survey. WIMS also offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of satellite workshops that complement the scope of the conference. The calls for WIMS’17 Tutorials and Workshops are published separately.


Conference Scope
----------------
WIMS solicits regular and work-in-progress research, discussion papers and industry experience report papers in related fields. Papers exploring new directions or areas are also welcome. In particular but not exclusively the submissions within the following major areas are relevant:

- Scalable Web and Data Architectures and Infrastructures
- Web Intelligence
- Web Mining, Information and Knowledge Extraction
- Web Semantics and Reasoning
- WIMS Applications
- Evaluation and Validation of WIMS Technologies and Applications

More details about the conference scope and topics can be found at:
http://www.units.it/cuzzocrea/confs/WIMS2017/


Conference Location
-------------------
Hotel Village La Principessa (http://www.hotellaprincipessa.it/), Amantea, Italy

Submission Guidelines
---------------------
Five types of submissions are solicited for the main conference:
i.	Regular research papers (12 ACM pages)
ii.	Short research papers (6 ACM pages)
iii.	Discussion, survey, or problem analysis papers (12 ACM pages)
iv.	Posters (4 ACM pages)

More details on the nature of the different submission types can be found at:
http://www.units.it/cuzzocrea/confs/WIMS2017/
