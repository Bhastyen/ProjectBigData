Subject: [liste-egc] postdoc FederatedQueryScaler: improving the
 performances of SPARQL,federated queries on bioinformatics endpoints

FederatedQueryScaler is an INRIA(https://www.inria.fr) "Exploratory
Research Project". It is a collaboration between the teams
DYLISS(http://www.irisa.fr/dyliss/) in Rennes and
WIMMICS(http://wimmics.inria.fr/) in Sophia Antipolis.
At the interface of data science and bioinformatics, RDF linked data
provide an increasing quantity of structured data that can
cross-reference across datasets. SPARQL offers a federated query
mechanism for writing federated queries that span multiple datasets.
However, although data are available in formats that make their
integration technically feasible, the two main challenges are that (1)
most users find it difficult to write SPARQL queries that fully leverage
datasets interoperability, and (2) the lack of performance of such
queries severly hinder their applicability.

FederatedQueryScaler aims at determing the optimal decomposition of
federated SPARQL queries, which is critical to linked data scalability.
Our approach will be based on determining an abstraction of each
endpoint's data, that represents the classes of the dataset entities,
and the relations between these classes. Abstractions are therefore
compact representations of the dataset structure, that support scaling
as they do not necessarily depend on the size of the dataset.

We are currently developing a tool that provides an intuitive
graph-based visual interface that automatically compose a SPARQL query
as the user navigates the dataset abstraction. Being able to compute
automatically the abstraction of a remote dataset would therefore allow
the user to combine compose a federated SPARQL query over multiple
remote datasets.
For addressing the challenge of executing such a query, it is necessary
to revisit how SPARQL engines decompose federated queries and process
the result. Linked data fragments are a recent breakthrough for
improving performances. In this context, we will examine how the
datasets abstractions can be combined with data fragments in
CORESE/KGRAM and the STTL language developed at WIMMICS.

We are offering a 12 to 18 months postdoctoral position for developing
the next generation of SPARQL query engines. The ideal profile would
combine a good knowledge of the Semantic Web technologies (RDF and
SPARQL) and programming skills.
