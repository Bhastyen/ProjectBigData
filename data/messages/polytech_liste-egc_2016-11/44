Environmental and more generally geospatial information is now provided =
by crowdsourcing but also by public administrations in the context of =
the open data policies. Analyses of such data are still challenging =
because of their heterogeneity (structural, semantic, spatial and =
temporal) and because of the difficulty in choosing the "best" knowledge =
discovery process to apply, according to the needs of the experts in the =
field. This special issue aims to provide high quality research covering =
all or part of the challenges mentioned above, from a theoretical or =
experimental point of view. Challenge about data science deals with =
creation, storage, search, sharing, modelling, analysis, and =
visualization of data, information, and knowledge. In Data Science =
context, spatio-temporal aspects are crucial in order to manage and mine =
data, to index and retrieve information, and finally to discover and =
visualize knowledge. By taking into account these spatio-temporal =
aspects, original methods have to be proposed for processing real and =
complex data from different domains, e.g., environment, agriculture, =
health, urban, and so forth.

Topics and scope of the proposed special issue
-----------------------
- Pre and post processing of environmental data
- Geographical information retrieval
- Spatial data mining and spatial data warehousing
- Knowledge discovery use-cases dedicated to environmental data
- Spatial text mining
- Spatial ontology
- Spatial recommendations and personalization
- Visual analytics for geospatial data
- Dedicated applications:
  * Spatio-temporal analytics platform
  * Urban traffic systems
  * Trajectory analysis
  * Land-use and urban policies
  * Land-use and urban planning analysis
  * Spatio-temporal analysis in Ecology and Agriculture
  * and so forth

Important Dates
-----------------------
- Manuscript submission due: 1st February 2017
- First round decision made: 1st May 2017
- Revised manuscript due: 1st June 2017
- Final decision made: 1st July 2017
- Final paper due: 30th July 2017  =20

Submission Guidelines
-----------------------
Please submit your paper via Springer=92s Editorial System at =
https://www.editorialmanager.com/jdsa/ by February 1, 2017.
Papers submitted to this special issue for possible publication must be =
original and must not be under consideration for publication in any =
other journal or conference. Previously published or accepted =
conference/workshop papers must contain at least 30% new material to be =
considered for the special issue (for workshop 50% new content is =
required). All papers are to be submitted by referring to =
http://www.springer.com/41060. During submission please select =93S.I.: =
Environmental and Geospatial DA=94 under Manuscript Category.
All manuscripts must be prepared according to the journal publication =
guidelines which can also be found on the website =
(http://www.springer.com/41060). Papers will be reviewed following the =
journal standard review process. International Journal of Data Science =
and Analytics: Data-driven scientific discovery is a key emerging =
paradigm driving research innovation and industrial development in =
domains such as business, social science, the Internet of Things, and =
cloud computing. The field encompasses the larger areas of data =
analytics, machine learning, and managing big data, while related new =
scientific challenges range from data capture, creation, storage, =
search, sharing, analysis, and visualization, to integration across =
heterogeneous, interdependent complex resources for real-time =
decision-making, collaboration, and value creation. The journal welcomes =
experimental and theoretical findings on data science and advanced =
analytics along with their applications to real-life situations.  =20
