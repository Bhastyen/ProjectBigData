Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence
 (KDBI - EPIA2017)



Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence (KDBI - EPIA2017)=20
----------------------------------------------------------------
thematic track of the 18th Portuguese Conference on Artificial=20
Intelligence (EPIA 2017)
Porto, Portugal, September 5-8, 2017. Web-page:=20
https://web.fe.up.pt/~epia2017/

Nowadays, business organizations moving towards decision-making=20
processes that are based on data. In parallel, advances in Information=20
Technology has given rise to the age of big data. Thus, the pressure to=20
extract as much useful knowledge from these data is very strong.=20
Knowledge Discovery (KD) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)=20
that aims to extract useful (and understandable) knowledge from complex=20
and/or large volumes of data. Business Intelligence (BI) is an umbrella=20
term that represents computer architectures, technologies and methods to=20
enhance managerial decision-making. Both KD and BI are faced with new=20
challenges, such as: Internet expansion, real-world with increasing=20
dynamic and unstable environments, integration of expert knowledge into=20
the data-driven learning, and better support of informed decisions. In=20
effect, several AI techniques can be used to address these problems,=20
such as Machine Learning/Data Mining/Data Science, Evolutionary=20
Computation and M!
  odern Optimization, Forecasting, Neural Computing and Deep Learning.

The aim of this workshop is to gather the latest research in KD and BI.=20
In particular, papers that describe experience and lessons learned from=20
KD/BI projects and/or present business and organizational impacts using=20
AI technologies, are welcome. Finally, we encourage papers that deal=20
with the interaction with the end users, taking into its impact on real=20
organizations.

Topics of interest
--------------------
A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest is defined as follows:

**   Knowledge Discovery (KD):
*	Data Pre-Processing;
*	Intelligent Data Analysis;
*	Temporal and Spatial KD;
*	Data and Knowledge Visualization;
*	Machine Learning (e.g. Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Deep=20
Learning, Bayesian Learning, Inductive and Fuzzy Logic) and Statistical=20
Methods;
*	Hybrid Learning Models and Methods: Using KD methods and Cognitive=20
Models, Learning in Ontologies, inductive logic, etc.
*	Domain KD: Learning from Heterogeneous, Unstructured (e.g. text) and=20
Multimedia data, Networks, Graphs and Link Analysis);
*	Data Mining and Machine Learning: Classification, Regression,=20
Clustering and Association Rules;
*	Ubiquitous Data Mining: Distributed Data Mining, Incremental Learning,=20
  Change Detection, Learning from Ubiquitous Data Streams;

**  Business Intelligence (BI)/Business Analytics/Data Science:
*	Methodologies, Architectures or Computational Tools;
*	Artificial Intelligence (e.g. KD, Evolutionary Computation,=20
Intelligent Agents, Logic) applied to BI: Data Warehouse, OLAP, Data=20
Mining, Decision Support Systems, Adaptive BI, Web Intelligence and=20
Competitive Intelligence.
  **  Real-word Applications:
*	Prediction/Optimization in Finance, Marketing, Medicine, Sales,=20
Production.
*	Mining Big Data and Cloud computing.
*	Social Network Analysis; Community detection, Influential nodes.


Paper submission
-----------------
All papers should be submitted in PDF format through EPIA 2017=20
submission Website (select =E2=80=9CKnowledge Discovery and Business=20
Intelligence=E2=80=9D track):
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/*conf=3Depia2017

Submissions must be original and can be of two types: regular=20
(full-length) papers should not exceed twelve (12) pages in length,=20
whereas short papers should not exceed six (6) pages.

Each submission will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the=20
Programme Committee. The reviewing process is double blind, so authors=20
should remove names and affiliations from the submitted papers, and must=20
take reasonable care to assure anonymity during the review process.=20
References to own work may be included in the paper, as long as referred=20
to in the third person.

All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings published by Springer=20
in the LNAI series (EPIA 2011 proceedings were indexed by the Thomson=20
ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, DBLP and ACM digital library).


Special Issue of the Journal Expert Systems
---------------------------------------------
Authors of the best papers presented at the KDBI 2017 track of EPIA will=20
be invited to submit extended versions of their manuscripts for a=20
special issue KDBI of the =E2=80=98The Wiley- Blackwell Journal Expert Sy=
stems:=20
The Journal of Knowledge Engineering=E2=80=99, indexed at ISI Web of Know=
ledge=20
(ISI impact factor JCR2015 of 0.947).

This special issue corresponds to the 4th KDBI special issue on Expert=20
Systems (ES) journal (e.g., the 2nd issue is available at:=20
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exsy.12087/abstract ).
