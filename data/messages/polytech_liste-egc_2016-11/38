*** organized back-to-back with ISMIS 2017 http://ismis2017.ii.pw.edu.pl =
 in Warsaw, June 26-29

FQAS is the premier conference focusing on the key issue in the =
information society of providing easy, flexible, and intuitive access to =
information to everybody. In targeting this issue, the conference draws =
on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database =
management, data science, information filtering, knowledge =
representation, knowledge discovery, analytics, soft computing, =
management of multimedia information, and human-computer interaction. =
The guiding topic of the FQAS conferences are innovative query systems =
aimed at providing easy, flexible and human-friendly access to =
information. Such systems are becoming increasingly important also due =
to the huge and always growing number of users as well as the growing =
amount of available information. Thus, the works related to the concepts =
of data science, data streams querying etc. are very welcome

Since 1994, the conference has provided a unique and multidisciplinary =
forum for researchers, developers and practitioners to explore and =
exchange new ideas and approaches in all mentioned research areas.

We invite submission of original research contributions, and proposals =
for invited sessions, panels, and tutorials. Topics of interest include, =
but are not limited to, the following in the context of intelligent =
information access and/or flexible query answering systems:

=C2=B7       Flexible question answering systems
