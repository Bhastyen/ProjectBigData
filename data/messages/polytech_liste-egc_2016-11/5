AIMS AND TOPICS

Recent technological advancements have led to a deluge of data from =
distinctive domains (e.g., health care and scientific sensors, =
user-generated data, Internet and financial companies, and supply chain =
systems) over the past decades.  Data Analytics examines such large =
amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other =
insights.=20
Data comes in different forms: (i) Structured data (i.e. data in =
traditional databases relatively easy to manage, store, query, and =
analyze), (ii) Unstructured data like documents. In order to manage the =
heterogeneity, different kinds of features associated with data have to =
be extracted and exploited (e.g. numerical, qualitative, textual, =
graphs, etc.). Approaches to analyze such mixed data include pre =
processing, data preparation, post processing, data mining, data =
visualization, and so forth.
In this context, the EAST track focuses on the study of =
variety/heterogeneity of data, one of the 3V of Big Data (volume, =
variety, and velocity). And more precisely, the track addresses the =
development of new approaches dedicated to this crucial issue.

Heterogeneity may appear in two different forms:
- Semantic: heterogeneous fields, heterogeneous data content, =
heterogeneous semantic sources (i.e. thesaurus), etc.
- Syntactic: heterogeneous texts (structured/unstructured, =
standard/non-standard languages, etc.), heterogeneous images and video, =
etc.

The thematic track EAST is devoted to compiling the state-of-the-art in =
managing heterogeneity for data analytics, from integration to =
visualization. It will highlight the recent advances in this research =
field. Particularly welcome are reports, research, position and =
application papers (medicine, biology, environment, agriculture, =
chemistry, financial, law, and so on), issued either from the academic =
or industrial worlds.


SUBMISSION

Submitted papers must be original, and not submitted concurrently to a =
journal or another conference. Double-blind reviewing will be provided, =
so submitted papers must use fake author names and affiliations. Papers =
must use the latest AAAI Press Word template or LaTeX macro package, and =
must be submitted as PDF through the EasyChair conference system.

There are three kinds of submissions:
- full paper - a paper of high quality, which will be published in the =
proceedings (up to 6 pages) and will be presented by the author in a =
corresponding track (20 minute oral presentation)
- short paper - a paper that shows some novelty and general interest, =
but is more preliminary or in the early stages of development, which =
also get published in the proceedings (up to 4 pages) and the author =
presents the work in a poster session
- poster abstract, which will be published as abstract only (up to 250 =
words) and the author presents the work in a poster session.
