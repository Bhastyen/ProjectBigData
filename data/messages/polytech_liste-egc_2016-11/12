** CALL FOR PAPERS **

  --backgound--

Nowadays, social platforms have become the most popular communication  =

system all over the world. In fact, due to the short format of messages =
 =

and the accessibility of these systems, users tend to shift from  =

traditional communication tools (such as blogs, web sites and mailing  =

lists) to social network for various purposes. Billions of messages are =
 =

appearing daily in these services such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, etc=
.  =

The authors of these messages share content about their private life,  =

exchanging opinions on a variety of topics and discussing a wide range o=
f  =

information news.

  --objective--

In light of this, the number of active users is estimated to 1 billion  =

worldwide, which makes these systems the fastest- growing web sites in t=
he  =

world. Even if these system cannot represent an alternative to the  =

authoritative information media, considering the number of its users and=
  =

the impressive response time of their contributions, they represent a so=
rt  =

of real-time news sensor that can also predate the best newspapers in  =

informing the web community about the emerging topics and trends. In fac=
t,  =

the most important information media always need a certain amount of tim=
e  =

to react to a news event; i.e. professional journalists require time,  =

collaborators and/or technology support to provide a professional report=
.  =

However a user can easily report, in few characters, what is happening i=
n  =

front of the user=E2=80=99s eyes, without any concern about the readers =
or the  =

writing style. These aspects make social services the most powerful sens=
or  =

for events detection and automatic news generation. The aim of this  =

workshop is to ask researchers to enter into such view, by studying how =
 =

Social platforms can be used in a real-time scenario to detect emerging =
 =

events and enrich them with contextual information like categorization, =
 =

named entities and relationships with other events and sources of  =

information.
