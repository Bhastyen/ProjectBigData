**Web Intelligence **An International Journal**

OVERVIEW
=========
Web Intelligence consists of a multidisciplinary area dealing with exploiting data and services over the Web, to create new data and services using both Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Communities appear as a first-class object in the areas of web intelligence and agent technologies, as well as a crucial crossroads of several sub-domains (i.e. user modelling, protocols, data management, data mining, content modelling, etc.). These sub-domains impact the nature of the communities and the applications which are related to them. These applications are numerous, and the success of well-known Social Network Sites for entertainment should not be allowed to over-shadow the other application domains, for instance in education, health, design, knowledge management, and so forth.

This special issue welcomes papers on topics such as:
- User centric application based on social intelligence
- Linked data and big data for e-Communities
- Semantics and ontologies for e-Communities
- SOA, services and cloud for e-Communities
- Multi-agent models and tools for e-Communities
- Storage, querying, and diffusion
- Social, psychological and economical aspects of e-Communities
- Innovation and e-Communities
- Social networks enhancements
- Mobility and context-awareness
- Spontaneous social networks
- e-Communities in ambient intelligence
- Transient e-Communities
- Personalisation, reputation and recommendations
- Privacy, security and trust aspects in e-Communities
- Applications of social networks in e-* (learning, health, government, games etc.)
- Performances evaluation, experiments, and user feed-back
- Process modelling for e-Communities
