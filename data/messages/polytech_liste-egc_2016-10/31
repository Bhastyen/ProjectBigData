POSTDOC OFFER

Title: Stream processing and complex event processing for Internet of Thing=
s

Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.2 [Database Management]: Systems

General Terms:
Algorithms, Design, Performance, Theory

Keywords:
Event streams, Pattern matching, Query optimization, Data analyses, Stream
processing, Complex event processing, Top-k, Smart metering, Internet of
Things (IoT)

GOALS

The postdoc will join the team "Connected Intelligence" of Hubert Curien
laboratory / Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet / Telecom Saint-Etienne. The new t=
heme
"Connected Intelligence" in the laboratory consists of specialists in
knowledge representation and reasoning in multi-agent systems and services
in social networks, virtual communities and recommendation. This theme
brings together researchers with expertise related themes including:
processing and data management, cloud architectures, knowledge
representation and reasoning in large scale environments, linking the
Internet of Things and Cloud Computing.
He/she will work on the design of an architecture and stream processing
algorithms for Internet of Things (IoT). IoT applications complexity and
the huge volume of data to be processed require adaptation strategies of
software architecture at different levels. The architecture and algorithms
that will be defined and prototyped in this work will exploit the
capabilities offered by the intelligent and smart meters and sensors.
He/she will advance the existing state of the art in stream processing and
Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems. CEP is like stream processing
systems, but it focuses on detecting complex patterns in the stream of
Data. CEP engine implements a processing tool for high-level events that
may result from low level factors or low level raw events. The analysis and
identification of causality relation between complex events and low-level
events from multiple streams of real-time data, allows to take effective
action and to take immediate action in response to specific scenarios.
The postdoc will improve the performance of the CEP systems and will extend
the state of the art by tackling the issues related to IoT such as
reliability, tackling inherent distribution of sensors over a large area,
the analysis of temporal-geospatial data, etc.
This work will thus provide:
=E2=80=A2 academic results on the themes of Stream processing and Complex E=
vent
Processing in IoT
=E2=80=A2 applicative results as a prototype in the ongoing projects in the=
 lab
demonstrating the interest of the defined models and algorithms

CONTRACT:

CDD of 1yr and the starting date is December 1, 2016. Remuneration will be
based on experience.


REQUIRED PROFILE:

PhD in Computer Science with 0-3 years experience
knowledge of topics: Data base, Query optimization,  Stream processing,
complex event processing, knowledge reasoning
Java, C / C ++
Ability to work in team, in an industrial and international environment

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR APPLICATION:

CV, cover letter and a list of publications two letters of references with
contact persons
