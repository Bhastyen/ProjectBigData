2nd International Workshop on Big Mobility Data Analytics (BMDA)
co-located with EDBT/ICDT Conference, March 26, 2019 (Lisbon, Portugal)
http://www.datastories.org/bmda19/ <http://www.datastories.org/bmda19/>

*Submissions due December 15, 2018 (11:59pm PDT)*

Mobility Data Analytics (BMDA) workshop, co-located with 2019 joint =
EDBT/ICDT Conference, aims at bringing together experts in the field =
from academia, industry and research labs to discuss the lessons they =
have learned over the years, to demonstrate what they have achieved so =
far, and to plan for the future of "mobility".

The objective of the BMDA workshop is to bring together researchers and =
practitioners interested in scalable data-intensive applications that =
manage and analyze big mobility data. The workshop will foster the =
exchange of new ideas on multidisciplinary real-world problems, =
discussion on proposals about innovative solutions, and identify =
emerging opportunities for further research in the area of big mobility =
data analytics, covering all layers of the Big Data Value Analytics =
(BDVA) reference model, namely data management, data processing, data =
analytics, and data visualization and user interaction. The workshop =
intends to bridge the gap between researchers and big data stakeholders, =
including experts from critical domains, such as urban / maritime / =
aviation transportation, human complex networks, etc.

We encourage submissions of papers that highlight the value of mobility =
data processing, analyzing, and mining on topics that include (but are =
not limited to) the following:
- Fundamentals of mobility data analytics
- Big data platforms for mobility data analytics
- Parallel / streaming data processing for mobility analytics
- Predictive analytics using mobility data
- Complex event detection for moving objects
- Visual analytics on big mobility data
- Mobility-as-a-Service
- Interactive traffic analysis with GPS data
- Urban / maritime / aviation traffic flow forecasting
- Urban / maritime / aviation travel time prediction
- Integration / interlinking of mobility with societal data
- Geosocial networks
- Philosophical / ethical / privacy issues on mobility data analytics

We invite papers discussing novel research and ideas without substantial =
overlap with papers that have been published or submitted to a journal =
or a conference with proceedings. Submitted papers can be of two types:
- Regular Research Papers: these papers should report original research =
results or significant case studies. They should be 5000-8000 =
<tel:5000-8000> words (at most 8 pages) long.
- Position Papers: these papers should report novel research directions =
or identify challenging problems. They should be at most 4 pages long.

Submissions should be formatted using the EDBT/ICDT 2019 camera-ready =
template and submitted through the workshop's submission system at =
EasyChair [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dbmda19 =
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dbmda19>]. Following the =
tradition of recent EDBT/ICDT workshops, all workshop papers will be =
published online at CEUR [http://ceur-ws.org/ <http://ceur-ws.org/>]. =
All submitted papers will be peer reviewed by at least three reviewers. =
If accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to =
present the work.

Selected accepted papers will be considered for a special section at a =
relevant journal (details to be announced).
