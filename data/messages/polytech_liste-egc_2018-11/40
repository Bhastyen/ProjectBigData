Subject: [liste-egc] CfP BIR@ECIR2019 - 8th international workshop on
 Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval

You are invited to submit to the 8th international workshop on =
Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR 2019), to be held as =
part of the 41st European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR =
2019).=20

=3D=3D=3D Important Dates =3D=3D=3D
- Submissions: 27 January 2019
- Notifications: 2 March 2019
- Camera Ready Contributions: 2 April 2019
- Workshop: 14 April 2019 in Cologne, Germany


=3D=3D=3D tl;dr =3D=3D=3D
The Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) workshop series at =
ECIR tackles issues related to academic search, at the crossroads =
between Information Retrieval and Bibliometrics.  BIR is a hot topic =
investigated by both academia (e.g., ArnetMiner, CiteSeerX, DocEar) and =
the industry (e.g., Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Semantic =
Scholar).  A one-day workshop is to be held at ECIR 2019 in Cologne, =
Germany.

Past BIR proceedings are online https://dblp.org/search?q=3DBIR.ECIR as =
open access.


=3D=3D=3D Keywords =3D=3D=3D
Academic Search, Information Retrieval, Digital Libraries, =
Bibliometrics, Scientometrics


=3D=3D=3D Workshop Topics =3D=3D=3D
We welcome submissions regarding all three aspects of the =
search/recommendation process:

  - User needs and behaviour regarding scientific information, such as:
      . Finding relevant papers/authors for a literature review.
      . Measuring the degree of plagiarism in a paper.
      . Identifying expert reviewers for a given submission.
      . Flagging predatory conferences and journals.

  - The characteristics of scientific information, such as:
      . Measuring the reliability of bibliographic libraries.
      . Spotting research trends and research fronts.

  - Academic search/recommendation systems, such as:
      . Modelling the multifaceted nature of scientific information.
      . Building test collections for reproducible BIR.
      . System support for literature search and recommendation.


We especially invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work =
as well as contributions from industry. Papers that investigate multiple =
themes directly are especially welcome.


=3D=3D=3D Aim of the Workshop =3D=3D=3D
Searching for scientific information is a long-lived information need.  =
In the early 1960s, Salton (1963) was already striving to enhance =
information retrieval by including clues inferred from bibliographic =
citations.  The development of citation indexes pioneered by Garfield =
(1955) proved determinant for such a research endeavour at the =
crossroads between the nascent fields of Information Retrieval (IR) and =
Bibliometrics [Bibliometrics refers to the statistical analysis of the =
academic literature (Pritchard, 1969) and plays a key role in =
scientometrics: the quantitative analysis of science and innovation =
(Leydesdorff & Milojevic, 2015)].  The pioneers who established these =
fields in Information Science---such as Salton and Garfield---were =
followed by scientists who specialised in one of these (White & McCain, =
1998), leading to the two loosely connected fields we know of today.

The purpose of the BIR workshop series founded in 2014 is to tighten up =
the link between IR and Bibliometrics.  We strive to get the =
=E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98citationists=E2=80=99 =
(White & McCain, 1998) active in both academia and the industry =
together, who are developing search engines and recommender systems such =
as ArnetMiner, CiteSeerX, DocEar, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic =
Search, and Semantic Scholar, just to name a few.

These bibliometric-enhanced IR systems must deal with the multifaceted =
nature of scientific information by searching for or recommending =
academic papers, patents, venues (i.e., conferences or journals), =
authors, experts (e.g., peer reviewers), references (to be cited to =
support an argument), and datasets.  The underlying models harness =
relevance signals from keywords provided by authors, topics extracted =
from the full-texts, coauthorship networks, citation networks, and =
various classifications schemes of science.
 =20
Bibliometric-enhanced IR is a hot topic whose recent developments made =
the news---see for instance the Initiative for Open Citations (Shotton, =
2018) and the Google Dataset Search (Castelvecchi, 2018) launched on =
September 4, 2018.  We believe that BIR@ECIR is a much needed scientific =
event for the =E2=80=98retrievalists=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98citationists=E2=
=80=99 to meet and join forces pushing the knowledge boundaries of IR =
applied to literature search and recommendation.

All submissions must be written in English following Springer LNCS =
author guidelines (6 to 12 pages) and should be submitted as PDF files =
to EasyChair. All submissions will be reviewed by at least two =
independent reviewers. Please be aware of the fact that at least one =
