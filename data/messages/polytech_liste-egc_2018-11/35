Subject: [liste-egc] [CfP] - 1st Workshop on Evaluation and Experimental
 Design in Data Mining and Machine Learning @ SDM 2019

*Description*
<br>
<br>
A vital part of proposing new machine learning and data mining approaches is
evaluating them empirically to allow an assessment of their capabilities.
Numerous choices go into setting up such experiments: how to choose the data,
how to preprocess them (or not), potential problems associated with the
selection of datasets, what other techniques to compare to (if any), what
metrics to evaluate, etc. and last but not least how to present and interpret
the results. Learning how to make those choices on-the-job, often by copying
the evaluation protocols used in the existing literature, can easily lead to
the development of problematic habits. Numerous, albeit scattered,
publications have called attention to those questions and have occasionally
called into question published results, or the usability of published methods.
At a time of intense discussions about a reproducibility crisis in natural,
social, and life sciences, and conferences such as SIGMOD, KDD, and ECML/PKDD
encouraging researchers to make their work as reproducible as possible, we
therefore feel that it is important to bring researchers together, and discuss
those issues on a fundamental level.
<br>
<br>
A related issue is directly related to the first choice mentioned above: even
the best-designed experiment carries only limited information if the
underlying data are lacking. We therefore also want to discuss questions
related to the availability of data, whether they are reliable, diverse, and
whether they correspond realistic and/or challenging problem settings.
<br><br>
*Topics*
<br><br>
In this workshop, we mainly solicit contributions that discuss those questions
on a fundamental level, take stock of the state-of-the-art, offer theoretical
arguments, or take well-argued positions, as well as actual evaluation papers
that offer new insights, e.g. question published results, or shine the
spotlight on the characteristics of existing benchmark data sets.
<br><br>
As such, topics include, but are not limited to:
- Benchmark datasets for data mining tasks: are they diverse/realistic/
challenging?
- Impact of data quality (redundancy, errors, noise, bias, imbalance, ...) on
qualitative evaluation
- Propagation/amplification of data quality issues on the data mining results
(also interplay between data and algorithms)
- Evaluation of unsupervised data mining (dilemma between novelty and
validity)
- Evaluation measures
- (Automatic) data quality evaluation tools: What are the aspects one should
check before starting to apply algorithms to given data?
- Issues around runtime evaluation (algorithm vs. implementation, dependency
on hardware, algorithm parameters, dataset characteristics)
- Design guidelines for crowd-sourced evaluations
<br><br>
The workshop will feature a mix of invited speakers, a number of accepted
presentations with ample time for questions since those contributions will be
less technical, and more philosophical in nature, and a panel discussion on
the current state, and the areas that most urgently need improvement, as well
as recommendation to achieve those improvements. Workshop submissions will be
published in the CEUR-WS workshop series. An important objective of this
workshop is a document synthesizing these discussions that we intend to
publish at a more prominent venue.
