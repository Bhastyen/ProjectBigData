Special Issue on the Sensors, Observations, Actuators and the Web of Linked
Data and Things

in Semantic Web Journal



* Important dates

Paper submission deadline: December 14 2018

Envisioned First round notification: February 2019



* Scope

The rapid advancement and ubiquitous penetration of mobile networks,
Web-based information creation and sharing, and software-defined networking
technology enable us to sense, predict and control the physical world using
information technology=E2=80=94on top of the resulting Internet of Things (=
IoT),
business models and processes have been redesigned on the Web across a
broad range of industries leading to the so-called Web of Things (WoT). To
maximize its social and economic benefit, issues of interoperability, data
and service mash-ups, the development of open platforms, and
standardization on the application layer have to be addressed.

The capabilities of new networks of devices presents us with several new
and complex challenges that need to be solved before data, device and
service interoperability on the Web of Things can deliver their promised
potential. Without connecting the data and its semantics that is generated
by potentially billions of sensing, actuating and sampling devices, the
users of the Web of Things will end up in silos of information that require
different applications to access and use it. A description of the
capabilities of these devices using semantic technologies may help in
deciding how to communicate with the device and manage the data that is
produced or the actions that can be performed. Besides the well researched
area of cloud computing, new approaches such as edge computing and fog
computing have been proposed to address parts of the scalability problem.
The goal of these new approaches is to not transport all data but only
relevant data across the Internet.

On the other hand, successfully interconnecting devices on the Web of
Things will lead to a deluge of data that will present scalability problems
to the data analysis and knowledge extraction and management. Further,
issues around access to devices and privacy issues of what information can
be shared in a highly interconnected Web of Things are also intensifying.



The focus of this special issue is to showcase novel approaches of applying
semantic technologies to solve the problems of device and data integration.
The topics of interest for the special issue include (but are not limited
to):

* Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for Web of Thing devices

* Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for Web of Things=E2=80=99 data

* Semantic technologies and Web of Things constraints and architectures

* Web of Things and Data applications and application development

* Semantic interoperability and standardization overcoming siloization of
IoT systems

* Coupling between semantics and other AI techniques for the Web of Things
and Data (deep learning, multi-agent systems, etc.)

* Trust, privacy, and security in the Web of Things and Data

* Experience in sensor network applications of semantic technologies
