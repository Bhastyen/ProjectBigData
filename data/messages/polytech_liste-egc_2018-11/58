Bonjour EGC,=20

Voil=E0 une offre de poste qui pourrait t'int=E9resser.=20

=3D=3D=3D=3D=20

Amadeus ( https://amadeus.com/en ) and the Zenith team of Inria ( https://t=
eam.inria.fr/zenith/ ) are seeking a postdoctoral fellow in A/B testing, cl=
ustering and time series analytics.=20

* Title: A/B testing guided clustering=20

* Description:=20

The post-doc position takes place in a new partnership between Amadeus and =
Inria. It is linked to Amadeus' developments in implementation of intellige=
nt and evolving flight recommendation search means for online travel agenci=
es (OTAs). The general principle is to choose recommendations by optimizing=
 several criteria simultaneously (price, duration of the trip, number of st=
ops, etc.). Each flight recommendation is associated with a score defined a=
s a linear combination of criteria and weight. Weights therefore define how=
 important each criterion is. To be able to adapt the importance of the cri=
teria according to the profile of the user, user queries are segmented by m=
eans of unsupervised classification (or clustering). Weight values are opti=
mized independently on each segment by maximizing the estimated reservation=
 probability of returned flight recommendations. Thus, a set of weights is =
associated with each of the user profiles, called segments. During the weig=
ht creation process, large volumes of data are used, especially during the =
segmentation phase. The ability of the flight recommendation search system =
to increase the conversion rate is evaluated using A / B test campaigns.=20

The expected work in this postdoc position is comprised of two complementar=
y topics:=20
1. optimizing the planning of A / B test campaigns,=20
2. developing incremental methods of adaptation of flight search segmentati=
on from the results of A / B tests.=20


The objective of the first point is to improve the use of A / B tests in or=
der to draw conclusions as quickly and as safely as possible, as well as to=
 be able to know at each stage the uncertainty about the results of the A /=
 B test.=20

The second topic is directly related to the first, since it is a question o=
f using the results of A / B test obtained on each segment to improve the s=
egmentation. The initial idea is to develop an incremental clustering algor=
ithm in which phases of search segmentation and A / B test follow one anoth=
er.=20

About Amadeus=20
Amadeus builds the critical solutions that help airlines and airports, hote=
ls and railways, search engines, travel agencies, tour operators and other =
travel players to run their operations and improve the travel experience, b=
illions of times a year, all over the world.=20

About Zenith=20
The Zenith project-team, headed by Patrick Valduriez, aims to propose new s=
olutions related to scientific data and activities. Our research topics inc=
orporate the management and analysis of massive and complex data, such as u=
ncertain data, in highly distributed environments.=20

* Skills and profile:=20

- Background in data mining / data analytics=20
- A Ph.D. in computer science or mathematics=20

* Environment, salary, duration:=20

The postdoc will be supervised by Amadeus and Inria, while being located in=
 the Amadeus facilities of Sophia Antipolis.=20

Net salary: up to 3300 Euros net/month depending on your experience.=20
Duration: 1 Year=20
Starting date: flexible but ideally as soon as possible.=20
