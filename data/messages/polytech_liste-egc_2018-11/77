Abstract.=20

For the last few decades, the volume of data has been increasingly growing.=
 The rapid advances that have been made in computer storage have offered a =
great flexibility in storing very large amounts of data in which, the minin=
g process is still facing numerous challenges for discovering knowledge and=
 hidden correlations. Data analytics in general, and data mining primitives=
 in particular, are a major source of bottlenecks in the operation of infor=
mation systems manipulating the huge amount of generated data. This is main=
ly due to their high complexity and intensive call to IO operations, partic=
ularly in massively distributed environments. Moreover, an important applic=
ation of data analytics is to discover key insights from the running traces=
 of the information system in order to improve its engineering. Mining Clos=
ed Frequent Itemsets (CFI) is one of these data mining techniques, associat=
ed with great challenges. Despite the answers that frequent itemset mining =
methods can provide about data, some hidden relationships cannot be easily =
driven and detected inside data. This is specifically the case when data ar=
e very large and massively distributed. To this end, a careful analysis of =
the informativeness of the itemsets would give more explanation about the e=
xisting correlations and relationships inside data. However, digging throug=
h very large amounts of data to determine a set of maximally informative it=
emsets (of a given size k) presents a major challenge in data mining. This =
is particularly the case as far as the size k of the informative itemsets t=
o be discovered is very high. Moreover, classification is one of the buildi=
ng bricks in data mining and information retrieval. The problem has been wi=
dely studied in centralized environments. However, in massively distributed=
 environments, parallel classification algorithms have not gained much in t=
erms of accuracy. To this end, our motivation behind the mining of informat=
ive patterns lies in the fact that they can be used effectively as a featur=
e selection application in classification algorithms. Indeed, from the lite=
rature, the informative patterns can show a major improvement in classifyin=
g documents and transactions. Thus, a deep modeled deployment of informativ=
e patterns as features for supervised classification use cases will be need=
ed to sketch the major improvement in accuracy rates in those use cases. In=
 this thesis, first we address the problem of CFI mining in big data. We ca=
ll for specific data analysis techniques, adopting a prime-number-based app=
roach in massively distributed environments to improve the performance of a=
 parallel CFI mining process. We introduce Distributed-Closed-Itemset-Minin=
g (Dcim), a parallel algorithm for mining CFIs from large amounts of data. =
Dcim allows discovering itemsets with better efficiency and result compactn=
ess. A key feature of Dcim is the combination of data mining properties wit=
h the principles of massive data distribution. Exhaustive experiments are c=
arried out over real world datasets to illustrate the efficiency of Dcim fo=
r large real world datasets with up to 53 million documents. The second pro=
blem we address in this thesis is the discovery of maximally informative k-=
itemsets (miki) from a huge incoming/outgoing data over a stream based on j=
oint entropy. We propose Parallel entropy computing over Streams (PentroS) =
a highly scalable, parallel miki mining algorithm that renders the mining p=
rocess of the large throughput of data succinct and effective over a data s=
treaming process. Its mining process is made up of only two efficient paral=
lel jobs. With PentroS, we provide a set of significant optimizations for c=
omputing the joint entropy of the miki having different sizes, which drasti=
cally reduces the latancy rate of the mining process. PentroS is extensivel=
y evaluated using a massive real-world data stream. Our experimental result=
s confirm the effectiveness of our proposal by the significant scale-up obt=
ained with lengthy itemsets and over very large throughputs of data. Finall=
y, we address the problem of parallel classification in highly distributed =
environments. We propose Ensemble of Ensembles of Classifiers (Eec), a para=
llel, scalable and highly accurate classifier algorithm. Eec renders a clas=
sification task simple, yet very efficient. Its working process is composed=
 of two simple and compact jobs. Calling to more than one classifier, Eec c=
leverly exploits the parallelism setting not only to reduce the execution t=
ime but also to significantly improve the classification accuracy by perfor=
ming two level decision making steps. We show that the Eec classification a=
ccuracy is improved by using informative patterns and that the classificati=
on error can be bounded to a small value. Eec is extensively evaluated usin=
g various real-world, large data sets. Our experimental results suggest tha=
t Eec is significantly more efficient and more accurate than alternative ap=
proaches.=20
