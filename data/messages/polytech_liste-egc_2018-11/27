The aim of this special issue on Advances on Managing ang Mining
Large-Scale Time Dependent Graphs (TD-LSG) is to bring together active
scholars and practitioners of dynamic graphs. Graph models and algorithms
are ubiquitous of a large number of application domains, ranging from
transportation to social networks, semantic web, or data mining. However,
many applications require graph models that are time dependent. For
example, applications related to urban mobility analysis employ a graph
structure of the underlying road network. Indeed, the nature of such
networks are spatiotemporal. Therefore, the time a moving object takes to
cross a path segment typically depends on the starting instant of time. So,
we call time-dependent graphs, the graphs that have this spatio-temporal
feature.

In this special issue, we aim to discuss the problem of mining large-scale
time-dependent graphs, since there are many real world applications deal
with a large volumes of spatio-temporal data (e.g. moving objects
trajectories). Managing and analyzing large-scale time-dependent graphs is
very challenging since this requires sophisticated methods and techniques
for creating, storing, accessing and processing such graphs in a
distributed environment, because centralized approaches do not scale in a
Big Data scenario.

Contributions will clearly point out answers to one of these challenges
focusing on large-scale graphs.

*Aims and Scope:*

Many research questions related to mining large scale time-dependent
graphs, will be at the heart of this special issue such as:

1. How to build a TD-LSG using spatio-temporal data or temporal traces in
general, such as to favor the mining process ?

2. How to inter-link and enrich TD-LSG with semantic resources during the
mining process ?

3. How to allow scalable mining tasks over a TD-LSG ?

4. How to organize and maintain a TD-LSG in distributed architecture, such
as to scale the mining process ??

The special issue aims at bringing together scholars and practitioners
active in dynamic graphs, to present their research, share their knowledge
and experiences, and discuss the current state of the art and the future
improvements.

*Topics:*

We encourage papers with important new insights and experiences on
knowledge discovery aspects with dynamic and evolving graphs. Those
contributions should shed light on one of the questions mentioned above,
related to the knowledge discovery process. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to, the following inter-linked topics, with regards to
mining process:

- Theoretical foundation of TD-LSG

- Construction and maintenance of TD-LSG

- Data quality in TD-LSG

- Data integration in TD-LSG

- Indexing techniques for TD-LSG

- Distributed algorithms & navigational query processing

- TD-LSG data mining: frequent pattern mining, similarity, cluster
analysis, predictive learning

- Trajectory mining in TD-LSG

- Probabilistic TD-LSG

- Applications related to TD-LSG
