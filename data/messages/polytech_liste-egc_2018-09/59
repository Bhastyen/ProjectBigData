CFP JURSE 2019 =E2=80=93 special session on Deep learning in urban remote=
 sensing

Dear colleagues,

In the context of JURSE 2019 (Vannes, France), the Joint Urban Remote=20
Sensing Event, we organize a half or a full day special session on=C2=A0 =
Deep=20
learning in urban remote sensing and its applications in different=20
domains (object detection & extraction, semantic segmentation, land=20
cover mapping, etc.).

The aim of this special session is to popularize the use of these=20
promising approaches. Indeed, although these methods have become very=20
popular in computer vision over the last ten years, they are not enough=20
validated on remote sensing applications, especially in the context of=20
urban environment analysis. Our objectives are to gather both computer=20
scientists (academics and professionals) familiar with deep learning and=20
end-users close to geographical and environmental sciences who could=20
give sense to raw data. We are also targeting potential new users=20
interested by these approaches in order to stimulate deeper=20
multidisciplinary interactions on this topic.
As a colleague working directly or indirectly on this topic, we would=20
like to check if such a special session would be of interest for you or=20
some of your collaborators. If this sounds good to you, we would be glad=20
to invite you to send a contribution to this scientific meeting. As you=20
will see in the following call for papers, *the deadline for paper=20
submission is October 20, 2018.*

http://jurse2019.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/flyer-v2-copie.jpg

Prospective authors are invited to contribute by submitting a full paper=20
in English of *no more than 4 pages double-column*, including=20
illustrations, results and references.
Submissions should be formatted in accordance with the IEEE guidelines.=20
All accepted papers will be considered for publication in IEEE Xplore.
Paper should=C2=A0to be submitted using the JURSE 2019 Easychair=20
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Djurse2019> and by selecting=20
"Deep learning in urban remote sensing" special session in the "Topics"=20
section of the submission form.

*Paper submission deadline is October 20, 2018*

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Best regards,
Jonathan Weber, Universit=C3=A9 de Haute-Alsace, France
