Subject: [liste-egc] R&D Technical Project Manager - H2020 project on Speech
 and Language Processing

Dear list,

Inria is seeking a Technical Project Manager for a new European (H2020 
ICT) collaborative project called COMPRISE.

COMPRISE is a 3-year Research and Innovation Action (RIA) aiming at new 
cost-effective, multilingual, privacy-driven voice interaction 
technology. This will be achieved through research advances in 
privacy-driven machine/deep learning, personalized training, automatic 
data labeling, and tighter integration of speech and dialog processing 
with machine translation. The technology will be based on existing 
software toolkits (Kaldi speech-to-text, Platon dialog processing, Tilde 
text-to-speech), as well as new software resulting from these research 
efforts. The consortium includes academic and industrial partners in 
France (Inria, Netfective Technology), Germany (Ascora, Saarland 
University), Latvia (Tilde), and Spain (Rooter).

The successful candidate will be part of the Multispeech team at Inria 
Nancy (France). As the Technical Project Manager of H2020 COMPRISE, 
he/she will be responsible for animating the consortium in daily 
collaboration with the project lead. This includes orchestrating 
scientific and technical collaborations as well as reporting, 
disseminating, and communicating the results. He/she will also lead 
Inriaâ€™s software development and demonstration tasks.

Besides the management of COMPRISE, the successful candidate will devote 
half of his/her time to other activities relevant to Inria. Depending on 
his/her expertise and wishes, these may include: management of R&D 
projects in other fields of computer science, involvement in software 
and technology development and demonstration tasks, building of industry 
relationships, participation in the setup of academic-industry 
collaborations, support with drafting and proofreading new project 
proposals, etc.

Ideal profile:
- MSc or PhD in speech and language processing, machine learning, or a 
related field
- at least 5 years' experience after MSc/PhD, ideally in the private sector
- excellent software engineering, project management, and communication 
skills

Application deadline: October 12, 2018

Starting date: December 1, 2018 or January 1, 2019
Duration: 3 years (renewable)
Location: Nancy, France
Salary: from 2,300 to 3,700 EUR net/month, according to experience
