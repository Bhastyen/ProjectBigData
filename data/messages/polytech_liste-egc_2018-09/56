DESCRIPTION
Machine learning approaches for intelligent text mining and retrieval
are actively studied by researchers in natural language processing,
information retrieval and other related fields. While supervised methods
usually attain much better performance than unsupervised methods, they
also require annotated data which is not always available or easy to
obtain. Hence, we encourage the submission of supervised, unsupervised
or hybrid methods for intelligent text retrieval tasks. Methods studying
alternative learning paradigms, e.g. semi-supervised learning,
weakly-supervised learning, zero-shot learning, but also transfer
learning, are very welcome as well.
This thematic special issue covers three research areas: natural
language processing, computational linguistics and information
retrieval. The submissions may address, but are not limited to, the
following topics:
=E2=80=93       information retrieval
=E2=80=93       information extraction
=E2=80=93       query processing
=E2=80=93        word sense disambiguation/discrimination
=E2=80=93        machine learning in NLP
=E2=80=93        sentiment analysis and opinion mining
=E2=80=93        contradiction and controversy detection
=E2=80=93        social media
=E2=80=93        summarization
=E2=80=93        text mining
=E2=80=93        text categorization and clustering
The submitted papers will undergo peer review process before they can be
accepted. Notification of acceptance will be communicated as we progress
with the review process.

HOW TO SUBMIT
Before submission authors should carefully read the Instruction for
Authors:
www.degruyter.com/view/supplement/s22991093_Instruction_for_Authors.pdf
Manuscripts can be written in TeX, LaTeX (strongly recommended) - the
journal=E2=80=99s LATEX template. Please note that we do not accept papers =
in
Plain TEX format. Text files can be also submitted as standard DOCUMENT
(.DOC) which is acceptable if the submission in LATEX is not possible.
For an initial submission, the authors are strongly advised to upload
their entire manuscript, including tables and figures, as a single PDF
file.

All submissions to the Topical Issue must be made electronically via
online submission system Editorial Manager:
www.editorialmanager.com/opencs/
All manuscripts will undergo the standard peer-review procedure (single
blind, at least two independent reviews). When entering your submission
via online submission system please choose the article type =E2=80=9CTI on
Information Retrieval=E2=80=9D.

The deadline for submission is 20th February 2019, but individual papers
will be reviewed and published online on an ongoing basis.

Contributors to the Topical Issue will benefit from:
=E2=80=93       NO submission and publication FEES
=E2=80=93        indexation by Clarivate Analytics - Web of Science (ESCI) =
and
SCOPUS
=E2=80=93        fair and constructive peer review provided by experts in t=
he field
=E2=80=93        no space constraints
=E2=80=93        convenient, web-based paper submission and tracking system=
 =E2=80=93
Editorial Manager
=E2=80=93        free language assistance for authors from non-English spea=
king
regions
=E2=80=93        fast online publication upon completing the publishing pro=
cess
=E2=80=93        better visibility due to Open Access
=E2=80=93        long-term preservation of the content (articles archived i=
n
