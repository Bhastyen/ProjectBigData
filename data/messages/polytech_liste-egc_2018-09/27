CALL FOR PAPERS

Int. J. of Continuing Engineering Education and Life-Long Learning

Special Issue on: "Knowledge Management Technologies in Education"

http://www.inderscience.com/info/ingeneral/cfp.php?id=3D4195

Guest Editors:
Assistant Prof. Inaya Lahoud-Lemaitre, Galatasaray University, Turkey
Assistant Prof. Elsa Cardoso, Instituto Universit=E1rio de Lisboa and Insti=
tuto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Investiga=E7=E3o e Desenvolv=

Prof. Nada Matta, University of Technology of Troyes, France


The high volume of information in organisations has led researchers to focu=
s on knowledge management as a form of competitive leverage. Knowledge mana=
gement (KM) aims to retrieve and share information within databases, docume=
nts and the know-how of employees to help cooperation and the improvement o=
f ideas, increasing opportunities for innovation, and thus enabling organis=
ations to better stay ahead of the competition.
Many organisations are implementing technologies and tools to better manage=
 their knowledge. Successful examples can be found in private and public or=
ganisations from different sectors: industry, services, healthcare and educ=
ation.
Interest in KM for the educational domain has been growing in recent years.=
 This can be seen in many series of conferences and workshops, such as Educ=
ational Knowledge Management (EKM), International Educational Data Mining (=
EDM) and International Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK), as well as i=
n papers discussing the role of knowledge management in higher education. A=
s education is increasingly occurring online or using educational software,=
 a larger amount of data is being generated and is available for analysis. =
New technologies such as semantic web and data mining techniques are being =
developed and tested, aiming for instance to improve educational effectiven=
ess, determine the key factors for the success of educational training, sup=
port basic research on learning, or manage educational training by satisfyi=
ng the needs of community, local industry or professional development.
For this special issue, we welcome submissions reporting original research =
that explores how KM technologies can solve problems related to the managem=
ent and analysis of educational information in schools, colleges, universit=
ies and other academic or professional learning institutions. We solicit pa=
pers focusing on how these technologies can face the current evolution of e=
ducational systems, especially the mobility of students/teachers involved i=
n interactive learning, the improvement of student retention and graduation=
 rates, the analysis of the importance of social media and games in learnin=
g, the production of exam questions from text files, and so on.

Subject Coverage

Suitable topics include, but are not limited, to the following:
Educational knowledge management and ontologies
Educational data mining
Educational linked data and semantic web
Knowledge acquisition, extraction and reuse in education
Artificial intelligence, robotics and human-computer interaction in educati=
on
Natural language processing to improve educational effectiveness
Providing feedback to teachers and other stakeholders generated from EKM me=
thods
Learner or student modelling
Learning analytics
Educational information systems
Improving educational software
Practice learning experiences and techniques
Evaluating and improving teachers' support
Educational knowledge evolution
Social media and games in learning
Experiences and examples of the use of KM in education
Global issues in education and research
Visualisation of student learning patterns


Notes for Prospective Authors

Submitted papers should not have been previously published nor be currently=
 under consideration for publication elsewhere. (N.B. Conference papers may=
 only be submitted if the paper has been completely re-written and if appro=
priate written permissions have been obtained from any copyright holders of=
 the original paper).
