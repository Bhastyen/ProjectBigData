Subject: [liste-egc] CFP Track on Intelligent Web Computing and Applications
 (I-WeCA) @ 14th IEEE SITIS 2018


CALL FOR PAPERS
----------------------------

Track on
Intelligent Web Computing and Applications (I-WeCA)

SITIS 2018 - The 14th IEEE - International Conference on
SIGNAL IMAGE TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS
Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, November 26-29, 2018
http://www=2Esitis-conf=2Eorg/

Description
----------------=20
The I-WeCA (Intelligent Web Computing and Applications) track of the 14th i=
nternational IEEE SITIS conference will focus on emerging concepts, archite=
ctures, protocols, and methodologies for both information management on the=
 Web and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that connect unlimited n=
umbers of smart objects to make our environment more interactive=2E In such=
 an interconnected world, information can be exchanged easily, tasks can be=
 processed collaboratively, devices and objects can be intelligently connec=
ted, communities of users with similar interests can be formed to achieve t=
heir goals efficiently and improve performance=2E Taking full advantage of =
these interconnected environments and available Web information as well to =
meet the ever increasing needs of emerging applications requires solutions =
that address new issues and challenges=2E Novel architectures and solutions=
 are being proposed promoting the dawn of the Internet of Things - or so ca=
lled Intelligent Web - era, ranging over enhanced and semantic-aware machin=
e-to-machine communications, resource sharing and processing of linked data=
 and devices, distributed computing and cooperative systems, mobile informa=
tion systems and services, semantic-based applications and intelligent data=
 processing, as well as enhanced data security and privacy protocols, etc=
=2E, to state a few examples=2E=20

The aim of this Intelligent Web computing and Applications (I-WeCA) track i=
s to provide an international forum for researchers, professionals, and ind=
ustrial practitioners to share their experiences and knowledge in this grow=
ing and highly important area of internet and Web technologies=2E
