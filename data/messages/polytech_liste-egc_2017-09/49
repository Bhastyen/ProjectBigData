1.    Context, Motivation and Objectives

In today's world, we find ourselves surrounded by many IoT-based 
cyber-physical systems that silently track our activities and collect 
sensitive information about us. Among the most prominent examples, we 
cite smart environments (e.g., smart homes and cities), quantified self 
technologies, smart energy meters, etc. While such systems promise to 
ease our lives, they raise major privacy concerns for their users, as 
the data collected is often privacy-sensitive, such as location of 
individuals, patients' vital signs.
In this work, we address these privacy concerns by proposing a solution 
that allows users to play a central role in protecting their privacy. 
Our project is motivated by two key observations. First, existing 
approaches for privacy protection in IoT-based cyber-physical systems 
give users only a passive role in protecting their privacy. Typically, 
users are prompted by the system to supply their privacy preferences as 
to who can access their data and for what purposes, and to accept a 
privacy policy referring to their preferences. However, users may not be 
aware of the direct and indirect risks associated with the disclosure of 
their data to a given entity to correctly specify their privacy 
preferences, which can change depending on the context of use. Second, 
recent studies [1,2] show that users are becoming more conscious of 
their privacy, and tend to take a pragmatic stance on sharing their 
private data, i.e., they would accept to release some of their private 
data in exchange for some incentives or services. However, making a 
tradeoff between the benefits generated by sharing a private data and 
associated privacy concerns remains a challenging task to users [3]. 
This means that users can paly a bigger role in protecting their 
privacy, but they need assistance to play that role and to derive values 
out of their private data.

In our work we will investigate the methodology to empower users to 
protect their privacy by themselves. That is, users should be enabled, 
before sharing a private data item (or a combination of data items) with 
a data consumer to:
•    Understand the privacy risks involved in that sharing;
•    Assess the value of the data to be shared, based on the identified 
privacy risks, and compare it to the potential benefits generated by the 
sharing;
•    Negotiate with data consumers to attain a (trade-off) data sharing 
decision satisfying both parties when conflicts happen;
•    Control the data release by applying the necessary data 
modification techniques (e.g., anonymization, data perturbation, 
modification, etc.) to implement the attained sharing decision.
