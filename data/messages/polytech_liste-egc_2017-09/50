*****************************
ECIR 2018 - European Conference on Information RetrievalCall for 
long/short papers & demo
Grenoble, France - March 26-29, 2018
http://www.ecir2018.org/
*****************************


Full Papers, Short Papers and Demonstrations

We are seeking the submission of high-quality and original full papers, 
short papers and demos. Submissions will be reviewed by experts on the 
basis of the originality of the work, the validity of the results, 
chosen methodology, writing quality and the overall contribution to the 
field of IR. Short Paper submissions addressing any of the areas 
identified in the conference topics are also invited. Authors are 
encouraged to describe work in progress and late-breaking research 
results. Demonstrations present research prototypes or operational 
systems. They provide opportunities to exchange ideas gained from 
implementing IR systems and to obtain feedback from expert users. 
Demonstration submissions are welcome in any of the conference topic areas.

Reproducible IR Research Track

We are happy to announce that the Reproducible IR Research Track 
introduced at ECIR 2015 will continue for ECIR 2018. Reproducibility is 
critical for establishing reliable, referenceable and extensible 
research for the future. Experimental papers are therefore most useful 
when their results can be tested and generalised by peers. This track 
specifically invites submission of papers reproducing a single or a 
group of papers, from a third-party where you have *NOT* been directly 
involved (e.g., *not* been an author or a collaborator). Emphasise your 
motivation for selecting the paper/papers, the process of how results 
have been attempted to be reproduced (successful or not), the 
communication that was necessary to gather all information, the 
potential difficulties encountered and the result of the process. A 
successful reproduction of the work is not a requirement, but it is 
important to provide a clear and rigid evaluation of the process to 
allow lessons to be learned for the future.


Submission guidelines

All submissions must be written in English following the ECIR guidelines 
(http://irsg.bcs.org/proceedings/ECIR_Draft_Guidelines.pdf) and the LNCS 
author guidelines and submitted electronically through the conference 
submission system. Full papers must not exceed 12 pages, short papers 
must not exceed 6 pages, demonstration papers must not exceed 4 pages, 
reproducible IR track papers must not exceed 12 pages, including 
references and figures. Full paper, short paper and reproducible IR 
track paper submissions will be refereed through double-blind peer 
review. Demonstration papers will undergo single-blind review. Accepted 
full papers, short papers, demos and reproducible IR track papers will 
be published in the conference proceedings published in the Springer 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The proceedings will be 
distributed to all delegates at the Conference. Accepted full papers, 
short papers, demos and reproducible IR track papers will have to be 
presented at the conference. Reproducible IR track papers will either be 
presented as a poster or as an oral presentation.
