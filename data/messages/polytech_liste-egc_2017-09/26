*CALL FOR PARTICIPATION*

*************************************************************************************************************************

*7th International Conference on Model and Data Engineering (MEDI 2017)**
**
**OCTOBER 4-6, 2017 - BARCELONA, SPAIN**
**
**http://www.essi.upc.edu/dtim/medi2017/*

*************************************************************************************************************************

_*Keynotes*_: http://www.essi.upc.edu/dtim/medi2017/keynotes

  * *Bernhard Rumpe (RWTH Aachen University, Germany). Talk: Advances in
    Model Language Engineering*

**

      o *Brief Bio:* Prof. Bernhard Rumpe is heading the Software
        Engineering department at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany.
        Earlier he had positions at INRIA/IRISA, Rennes, Colorado State
        University, TU Braunschweig, Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
        and TU Munich.   His main interests are rigorous and practical
        software and system development methods based on adequate
        modeling techniques. This includes agile development methods
        like XP and SCRUM as well as model-engineering based on UML-like
        notations and domain specific languages. He has to many modeling
        techniques, including the UML standardization. He also applies
        modeling, e.g. to autonomous cars, human brain simulation, BIM
        energy management, juristical contract digitalization,
        production automation, cloud, and many more. He is author and
        editor of nine books and Editor-in-Chief of the Springer
        International Journal on Software and Systems Modeling
        (www.sosym.org). His newest books "Agile Modeling with the UML"
        and "Engineering Modeling Languages: Turning Domain Knowledge
        into Tools" were published in 2016.

  * *Panos Vassiliadis (University of Ioannina, Greece)**: Talk: Schema
    Evolution and Gravitation to Rigidity: a tale of calmness in the
    lives of structured data*

**

      o *Brief Bio: *Prof. Panos Vassiliadis received his Diploma in
        Electrical Engineering and his PhD in Computer Science from the
        National Technical University of Athens in 1995 and 2000,
        respectively. He joined the Department of Computer Science &
        Engineering of the University of Ioannina in 2002. Prof.
        Vassiliadis has conducted research in the general area of data
        management with a notable focus on data warehousing (metadata
        management, OLAP, and quite emphatically, ETL) for long. Α
        common thread in his work is the focus on the investigation of
        how the rigorous modeling of data, software and their
        interdependence can be exploited for the design, visualization
        and evolution management of data-intensive software ecosystems.
        Prof. Vassiliadis has more than 100 publications in
        international books, journals and conferences. He is the
        co-editor of the book “Fundamentals of Data Warehouses”
        (Springer), one of the first books that founded the area and is
        member of the Steering Committee of the International Workshop
        of Data Warehousing and OLAP" (DOLAP). Moreover, Prof.
        Vassiliadis has an active service to the scientific community as
        a reviewer and PC chair. More information is available at
        http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~pvassil.
