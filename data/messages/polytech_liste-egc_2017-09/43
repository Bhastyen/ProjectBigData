13th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Cognitive 
Science
NLPCS 2018
11-12 September 2018
Krakow, Poland

Scope of the workshop
The international workshops of Natural Language and Cognitive Science 
(NLPCS) are dedicated to exploring the special relationship between 
natural language processing and cognitive science and the contribution 
of computer science to these two fields.  Cognitive science is the study 
of mind and intelligence. As Poibeau and Vasishth (2016) explain, 
researchers from the cognitive science field are overwhelmed by the 
technical complexity of natural language processing and natural language 
processing researchers have not recognised the contribution of cognitive 
science to their work. NLPCS which was launched in 2004, have provided a 
strong platform supporting research projects which acknowledge the 
importance of interdisciplinary approaches, and bringing together 
computer scientists, cognitive and linguistic researchers to improve our 
understanding of the human language system.
  There is an increasing interest in research related to the human brain 
and human language, and their findings and advances will contribute to 
advance our study of natural language processing. Consequently, NLPCS 
2018 welcomes contributions from cognitive neuroscience which relate to 
the human language and workings of the human brain.

Hence, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Cognitive and Psychological Models of NLP
Cognitive Neuroscience of Language
Computational Models in Cognitive Neuroscience
Computational Models of NLP
Corpus Linguistics
Discourse Processing
Emotion and Language Processing
Evolutionary NLP
Multi-Lingual Processing
Multimodality in Speech / Text Processing
Natural Language Interfaces and Dialogue Systems
Neural bases of Language
Pragmatics and NLP
Speech Processing
Social Cognition of Language
Text Mining
Text Summarisation and Information Extraction
Tools and Resources in NLP
