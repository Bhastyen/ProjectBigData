Camera-Ready Submission : April 15, 2017


-------------- INTRODUCTION
The goal of this track is to bring together researchers and
practitioners both from the Academia and from the Industry working in
the areas of the adaptation and reconfiguration of distributed
systems. Different investigation topics are involved, such as: CBSE,
Web service, cloud applications, mobile applications, Functional and
Non-Functional requirements (QoS, performance, resilience),
monitoring, diagnosis, decision and execution of adaptation and
reconfiguration. Different research areas are covered: concepts,
methods, techniques, and tools to design, develop, deploy and manage
adaptive and reconfigurable software systems.

The concept of adaptive and reconfigurable software systems has been
introduced in order to describe architectures, which exhibit such
properties. An adaptive and reconfigurable software system can repair
itself if any execution problems occur, in order to successfully
complete its own execution, while respecting functional and
Non-Functional agreements. In the design of an adaptive and
reconfigurable software system, several aspects have to be considered.
For instance, the system should be able to predict or to detect
degradations and failures as soon as possible and to enact suitable
recovery actions.

-------------- TOPICS
For this track, contributions are devoted to functional and non
functional adaptability and reconfiguration management in
service-oriented and component-based software systems.
Specifically, the relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

-Distributed and centralized collaborative solutions for the diagnosis
and repair of software systems
-Design for the diagnosability and repairability
-Collaborative Management of Non-Functional requirements (quality,
security, robustness, availability)
-Monitoring simple and composite architectures, components and services
-Semantic (or analytic) architectural and behavioral models for
monitoring of software systems
-Dynamic reconfiguration of cloud and mobile applications
-Collaborative planning and decision making
-Collaborative technologies for ensuring autonomic properties
-Predictive management of adaptability.
-Collaborative Management of autonomic properties
-Experiences in practical adaptive and reconfigurable applications
-Tools and prototypes for managing adaptability of applications


-------------- PAPER SUBMISSION
Papers up to six  double-column pages (including figures, tables and
references) should contain original contributions not published or
submitted elsewhere and are to be formatted according to the IEEE template.
Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers for ensuring high
quality.
Authors must upload their paper as PDF file using the EasyChair submission
system: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwetice2017
