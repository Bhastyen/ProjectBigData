Nowadays, business organizations moving towards decision-making=20
processes that are based on data. In parallel, advances in Information=20
Technology has given rise to the age of big data. Thus, the pressure to=20
extract as much useful knowledge from these data is very strong.=20
Knowledge Discovery (KD) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI)=20
that aims to extract useful (and understandable) knowledge from complex=20
and/or large volumes of data. Business Intelligence (BI) is an umbrella=20
term that represents computer architectures, technologies and methods to=20
enhance managerial decision-making. Both KD and BI are faced with new=20
challenges, such as: Internet expansion, real-world with increasing=20
dynamic and unstable environments, integration of expert knowledge into=20
the data-driven learning, and better support of informed decisions. In=20
effect, several AI techniques can be used to address these problems,=20
such as Machine Learning/Data Mining/Data Science, Evolutionary=20
Computation and Modern Optimization, Forecasting, Neural Computing and=20
Deep Learning.

The aim of this workshop is to gather the latest research in KD and BI.=20
In particular, papers that describe experience and lessons learned from=20
KD/BI projects and/or present business and organizational impacts using=20
AI technologies, are welcome. Finally, we encourage papers that deal=20
with the interaction with the end users, taking into its impact on real=20
organizations.

Topics of interest

Methods;
*       Hybrid Learning Models and Methods: Using KD methods and=20
Cognitive Models, Learning in Ontologies, inductive logic, etc.
*       Domain KD: Learning from Heterogeneous, Unstructured (e.g. text)=20
and Multimedia data, Networks, Graphs and Link Analysis);
*       Data Mining and Machine Learning: Classification, Regression,=20
Clustering and Association Rules;
*       Ubiquitous Data Mining: Distributed Data Mining, Incremental=20
Learning,  Change Detection, Learning from Ubiquitous Data Streams;

**  Business Intelligence (BI)/Business Analytics/Data Science:
*       Methodologies, Architectures or Computational Tools;
*       Artificial Intelligence (e.g. KD, Evolutionary Computation,=20
Intelligent Agents, Logic) applied to BI: Data Warehouse, OLAP, Data=20
Mining, Decision Support Systems, Adaptive BI, Web Intelligence and=20
Competitive Intelligence.

**  Real-word Applications:
*       Prediction/Optimization in Finance, Marketing, Medicine, Sales,=20
Production.
*       Mining Big Data and Cloud computing.
*       Social Network Analysis; Community detection, Influential nodes.


Paper submission
-------------------------
All papers should be submitted in PDF format through EPIA 2017=20
submission Website (select =E2=80=9CKnowledge Discovery and Business=20
Intelligence=E2=80=9D track):
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/*conf=3Depia2017=20
<https://www.easychair.org/conferences/*conf=3Depia2017>

Submissions must be original and can be of two types: regular=20
(full-length) papers should not exceed twelve (12) pages in length,=20
whereas short papers should not exceed six (6) pages.

Each submission will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the=20
Programme Committee. The reviewing process is double blind, so authors=20
should remove names and affiliations from the submitted papers, and must=20
take reasonable care to assure anonymity during the review process.=20
References to own work may be included in the paper, as long as referred=20
to in the third person.

All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings published by Springer=20
in the LNAI series (EPIA 2011 proceedings were indexed by the Thomson=20
ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, DBLP and ACM digital library).
