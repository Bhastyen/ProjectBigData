3rd International Conference on Knowledge Management, Information and  
Knowledge Systems (KMIKS 2017)

We invite you to submit a paper to KMIKS 2017 conference in Hammamet,  
Tunisia, April 20-22, 2017

Conference URL : http://www.kmiks.net/


The international conference on Knowledge Management, Information and  
Knowledge Systems (KMIKS) aims to gather both researchers and  
practitioners to discuss organizational, technological and  
socio-cultural aspects of research and development of knowledge  
management systems.
More and more organizations are becoming aware of the importance of  
tacit and explicit knowledge owned by their members which corresponds  
to their experience and accumulated knowledge about the firm  
activities. However, considering the large amount of knowledge created  
and used in the organization, especially with the evolution of  
information and communications technologies, the firm must first  
determine the specific knowledge on which it is necessary to focus.  
Creating activities to enhance identification, preservation, and use  
of this knowledge is a powerful mean to improve the level of the  
economic performance of the organization. Thus, companies invest on  
knowledge management programs, in order to develop a knowledge sharing  
and collaboration culture, to increase individual and organizational  
learning, to make easier accessing and transferring knowledge, and to  
insure knowledge preservation. Several researches can be considered to  
develop knowledge management programs supported by information and  
knowledge systems, according to their context, their culture and the  
stakeholders’ viewpoints.
Researchers and practitioners are invited to propose recent advances  
in methodologies, models and tools for knowledge management within  
organizations.

Topics of interest will include, but are not limited to:
Methodologies and computer supporting tools for knowledge management
Models for knowledge management
Knowledge sharing and collaboration
Knowledge retention and transfer
Decision support systems for knowledge management
Knowledge management systems
Knowledge management and business process modeling

MOOC for Knowledge sharing
Smart city and knowledge city
