Subject: [liste-egc] Postdoc opening semantic web / ontology matching in
 Montpellier, France

— apologies for multiple receptions —

Dear colleagues,

The NUMEV Labex [1] and AgroPortal project [2], building an ontology 
repository for agronomy, are offering a 1-year postdoc position for 
2017-2018 in Montpellier, to work on agronomical ontologies and their 
alignments as well as take part in the international GACS initiative 
(http://www.agrisemantics.org/gacs/).

Below is a short description of the position.

—
Abstract:
Standards vocabularies and ontologies are key elements to achieve data 
interoperability. The AgroPortal project [2] develops and supports a 
reference ontology repository for agronomy, plant sciences, biodiversity 
and nutrition. We have already designed and implemented an advanced 
prototype offering ontology-based services that hosts 64 ontologies or 
vocabularies including some reference resources in the domain: Agrovoc, 
NAL thesaurus, Crop Ontology, etc. One of the challenges when dealing 
with multiple ontologies is to determine their overlap and align them.
We are offering a postdoc position to develop ontology mapping 
capabilities to align AgroPortal ontologies and participate into the 
international Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS) project. With 
the experience and technology developed with the YAM++ application 
(LIRMM’s ontology alignment matcher), we will make AgroPortal a 
state-of-the-art platform for mapping extraction, generation, 
validation, evaluation, storage and retrieval by adopting a complete 
semantic web and linked open data approach and engaging the community 
for curation. We will first focus on the ontologies of the Montpellier 
community (agronomy, food, biodiversity) and then join the GACS project 
(integration of Agrovoc, NALt & CABt) in partnership with RDA 
AgriSemantics working group.

More details can be found here: [3][4].

Please, consider transferring  the job description in your labs and 
networks.

All the best,
Konstantin Todorov
