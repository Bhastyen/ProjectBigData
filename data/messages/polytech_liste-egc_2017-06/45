SOFSEM 2018 consists of three tracks covering major subareas of current 
computer science: the traditional track on Foundations of Computer 
Science and two tracks devoted to leading developments in areas – 
Software Engineering: Methods, Tools, Applications, and Data, 
Information and Knowledge Engineering. Original contributions are 
solicited, presenting new research results in the theory and practice of 
computer science in each subarea designated for SOFSEM 2018. Each track 
has its own program chair and program committee for peer reviewing and 
feedback to authors. Please consider the appropriate track of SOFSEM 
2018 for your contribution.

*Data, Information and Knowledge Engineering**Track:
*

*Track Chair: Ladjel Bellatreche, ISAE-ENSMA, Poitiers, France 
(bellatreche@ensma.fr)
*

The track is devoted to all aspects of eliciting, acquiring, modeling, 
storing, and managing data, information, and knowledge. Contributions 
concerning all steps in the development of data and knowledge-intensive 
systems – theoretical foundations, design, implementation and 
maintenance techniques – are welcome.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

  * Big Data storage, processing and analytics,
  * business process modeling, automation, and management
  * data and information modeling,
  * data and information semantics,
  * data integration, data cleaning,
  * data intensive applications,
  * data warehousing,
  * data mining, knowledge discovery and machine learning,
  * data privacy and security,
  * information retrieval,
  * intelligent agents, multi-agent systems,
  * knowledge modeling and processing,
  * knowledge acquisition and engineering,
  * linked data and open data,
  * mobile data and information,
  * multimedia, spatial, and temporal data and knowledge,
  * parallel and distributed data platforms
  * probabilistic databases, uncertainty and approximate querying,
  * query and natural language processing,
  * provenance and trust in data management and knowledge engineering,
  * stream data management,
  * web and semantic web data and knowledge engineering.

*Submission*


Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting 
original unpublished research in any one of the tracks of the 
Conference. Simultaneous submission to other conferences or workshops 
with published proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions must be formatted in LNCS style and must not exceed 12 
pages, excluding references. Proofs omitted for space reasons must be 
placed in an appendix to be read by the program committee at its 
discretion. The first page must include an indication whether the paper 
is to be considered for the Student Research Forum (including the Best 
Student Paper Award, see below).

Papers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair at 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sofsem2018.


*Student Research Forum*

PhD students may submit their paper in any one of the SOFSEM tracks, as 
part of the Student Research Forum (SRF). To be eligible for the SRF, 
all authors must be students (except for their advisors). All student 
papers are reviewed by the Program Committee of the respective track as 
regular submissions. However, those not accepted for the main Springer 
LNCS proceedings but still proposing novel and contributing ideas will 
be reviewed again. Well written and promising student papers will be 
published in a separate online document.

During the conference there will be a pecial Session devoted to the SRF 
papers which includes (i) oral presentation of the papers for the 
plenary SOFSEM audience, and (ii) a poster session to enable further 
discussion between student authors and SOFSEM participants. Best Student 
Paper and Best Student Presentation Awards will be awarded during the 
conference.

Submissions to the SRF must satisfy the same format requirements and 
should be submitted according to the same time schedule as regular 
submissions.

Formatting Instructions for Submissions
Your submission has to follow the regular format of the Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science. Do not change the settings of margins and vertical 
spacing, and use numbered pages. Submissions must not exceed 12 pages 
(excluding references).

Submit your paper in PDF, no later than the deadline using EasyChair.

By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance 
at least one of the authors must register at SOFSEM 2018, attend the 
conference, and present the paper.
