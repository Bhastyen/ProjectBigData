Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and =
exponential use of digital components leads to the emergence of =
intelligent environments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the =
web and composed of multiple and independent entities such as =
individuals, organizations, services, software and applications sharing =
one or several missions and focusing on the interactions and =
inter-relationships among them. With the help of the computational =
intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties =
(such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) =
environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital =
components", in which resources provided by each entity are properly =
conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly =
comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* =
properties platforms.

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are =
highly complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor =
understanding as to how managing resources will empower digital =
ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The =
application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the =
understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact =
to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and =
knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, =
models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web =
technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, =
artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to =
support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their =
resources.

The International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems =
(MEDES),previously named "The International Conference on Management of =
Emergent Digital EcoSystems", aims to develop and bring together a =
diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industry =
interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to =
resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current approaches and =
technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end.

MEDES 2017 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results =
or novel ideas in all areas of Emergent Digital EcoSystems.  At the same =
time, the conference calls  for short papers presenting interesting and =
exciting recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that are not =
quite ready, and preferably include a system demonstration.=20


Topics=20
-------
MEDES 2017 seeks contributions in the following areas:


- Digital Ecosystem Infrastructure
- Data & Knowledge Management
- Computational and Collective Intelligence
- Semantic Computing
- Software ecosystems for software engineering
- Big Data
- Services
- Trust, Security & Privacy
- Software Engineering
- Internet of Things and Intelligent Web
- Cyber Physical Systems
- Social and Collaborative Platforms
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Open Source
- Applications (Logistics, Energy, Healthcare, Environment, Smart =
Cities, Digital Humanities, Robotics, etc.)
- Complex Systems and Networks


Paper Submission
----------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be =
uploaded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at =
most 8 ACM single-space printed pages. Papers that fail to comply with =
length limit will be rejected.=20

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After =
the preliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and =
arguments all reviewer inquiries and their comments. Based on the =
rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with the final decision. =
Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, =
originality, technical soundness, and quality of presentation. =
Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging =
positions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems. At =
least one author should attend the conference to present the paper.=20

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the =
ACM Digital Library and DBLP.
