*** Call for Paper ***

IWCDF 2017 - 1st International Workshop on Computational Document =
Forensics
in cunjunction with ICDAR 2017=20

Kyoto, Japan

12 November, 2017

http://iwcdf2017.univ-lr.fr <http://iwcdf2017.univ-lr.fr/>

*** Deadline: 15 July 2017  ***

Everywhere around the world, industries and government processes are =
being more and more digitized. Document management systems and digital =
safe-boxes are particularly concerned by these questions, since =
documents generally remain the basis of many decisions for transactions, =
contracts, communication,... Documents also remain the proofs for many =
legal issues. As a consequence, it becomes absolutely essential to =
develop computational forensic science applied to documents and to =
create the conditions for protecting documents, for confirming their =
authenticity and for detecting frauds.

The First International Workshop on Computational Document Forensics =
aims at addressing the theoretical and practical works related to this =
field and creating a space for discussions between people working on =
this issues in different areas such as document and speech processing, =
digital security, biometry, forensic sciences=E2=80=A6

Instructions to Authors

Papers should not exceed 5 printed pages in IEEE format
Proceedings will be published by IEEE CPS, along with the proceedings of =
ICDAR 2017.

Topics of Interest include, but not limited to :

Prevention of forgeries in documents
Detection of forged documents
Detection of fake documents
Detection of forgeries in printed and rescanned documents
Authentication of documents
Forgery localisation
Copyright protection
Watermarking
Digital signatures
Handwriting and signature authentication
Important Dates
