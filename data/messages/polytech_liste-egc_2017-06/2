Subject: [liste-egc] Multi-Plant Photovoltaic Energy Forecasting Challenge
 @ECML-PKDD 2017 - Call for challenger

Dear all,
 I will invite you to participate to the Multi-Plant Photovoltaic Energy =
Forecasting Challenge

Multi-Plant Photovoltaic Energy Forecasting Challenge

The urgent need to reduce pollution emission has made renewable energy a =
strategic European Union (EU) and international sector. This has =
resulted in an increasing presence of renewable energy sources and thus, =
significant distributed power generation. The main challenges faced by =
this new energy market are grid integration, load balancing and energy =
trading.

In order to face these challenges, it is of paramount importance to =
monitor the production and consumption of energy, both at the local and =
global level, to store historical data and to design new, reliable =
prediction tools.

In this challenge, we focus our attention on photovoltaic (PV) power =
plants, due to their wide distribution in Europe. During the last years, =
the forecast of PV energy production has received significant attention =
since photovoltaics are becoming a major source of renewable energy for =
the world. Forecast may apply to a single renewable power generation =
system, or refer to an aggregation of large numbers of systems spread =
over an extended geographic area.

Organization:=20
