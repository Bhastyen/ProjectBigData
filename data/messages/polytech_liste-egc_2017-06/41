Submission deadline: July 15th, 2017 [EXTENDED]
  
The FIRST ICDAR WORKSHOP ON OPEN SERVICES AND TOOLS (OST) held during the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION (ICDAR 2017).
   http://diuf.unifr.ch/diva/ost2017
   November 10-11, 2017,  Kyoto, Japan
  
  
** Scope **
The 1st ICDAR Workshop on Open Services and Tools for Document Analysis (ICDAR-OST) is a two-day event which aims at promoting open tools, software, open services (for processing, evaluation or visualization), as well as facilitating public dataset usage, in the domain of Document Image Analysis Research, building on the experience of our community and of other ones. Such tools, softwares, services, formats or datasets should observe the principles of being reusable (I can use it on my data), transferable (I can use it on my premises) and reproducible (I can obtain the same results).
  
The accepted contributions are presented during interactive pitch and demo sessions, enabling authors to advertise their work, identify potential issues and solutions in their approach, as well as igniting collaboration with other participants. While this is encouraged, releasing tools with a free/open-source license is not required.
  
ICDAR-OST is a two-day workshop. The first day comprises interactive pitch and demo sessions, group brainstormings, and a keynote speech of Pascal MONASSE (ipol.im editor, co-chair of ICPR RRPR workshop [4]). The second day features a hackathon to enable participants to collaborate on issues identified during the first day.
  
  
** Paper Submission **
Papers should be formatted with the style files/details available at Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings [1]. Paper size is US letter. By submitting a manuscript to ICDAR2017 OST, authors agree to adhere the IAPR Statement of Ethics [2]. Papers must be submitted using dedicated submission system [3]. Papers should contain up to 4 pages + a short demo video if relevant.
  
The accepted papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society's Conference Publishing Services (CPS) and included in IEEE Xplore Digital Library, along with the proceedings of the main conference, ICDAR 2017.
  
We offer two different submission formats:
1.    ICDAR Reproducible Research Companion Papers, which must accompany a paper submitted to the main conference and detail the technical aspects of the software developed and openly released. This format is adapted from the ICPR RRPR Workshop [4] and will allow authors who release their methods to explain how to reuse them, provide examples and showcase, what they can achieve. Furthermore, papers should either include a section in the paper, or explanation on the public repository how reported results can be reproduced. Papers accepted in this format will get a special listing on the workshop’s website and a “Verified Reproducible Research” badge should be added to the main conference paper [to be confirmed].
  
2.    Original Software Papers, which introduce a newly released method, tool, service or format. Authors can submit papers to promote and showcase finished or ongoing work that are publicly available, preferably under an open source license. Details about installation, code source availability, documentation and evolution will be expected is this format promoting the dissemination of reusable software.
  
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Fully Open Source Tools
- Web Services for Document Image Analysis
- Collaborative Platforms
- Creating Ground Truth
- Performance Evaluation
- Coordination systems for DAR
- Deployment of document image processing tools for production
- All methods or tools related to Document Image Analysis Research in general
