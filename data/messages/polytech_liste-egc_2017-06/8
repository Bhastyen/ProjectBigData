Subject: [liste-egc] Mars Express Power Challenge @ECML-PKDD 2017 - Call for
 challenger

Dear all,
 I will invite you to participate to the Mars Express Power Challenge


Mars Express Power Challenge

It has now been more than 12 years that the Mars Express Orbiter (MEX) =
provides science data from Mars about its ionosphere and ground =
subsurface composition. The 3D imagery of Mars has provided the =
community with unprecedented information about the planet. Today, thanks =
to the work of careful and expert operators, Mars Express Orbiter still =
provides information that supports ground exploration missions on Mars =
(such as Curiosity, Opportunity, etc.) and a lot of other research.

The Mars Express Orbiter is operated by the European Space Agency from =
its operations centre (Darmstadt, Germany) where all the telemetry is =
analysed. The health status of the spacecraft is carefully monitored to =
plan future science observations and to avoid power shortages.

Operators of Mars Express keep track of the thermal power consumption =
thanks to the telemetry data. The spacecraft uses electric power coming =
from the solar arrays (or batteries, during eclipses) not only to supply =
power to the platform units, but also to the thermal subsystem, which =
keeps the entire spacecraft within its operating temperature range.

The Mars Express Power Challenge focuses on the difficult problem of =
predicting the thermal power consumption. More than six Earth years of =
Mars Express telemetry are made available and you are challenged to =
predict the thermal subsystem power consumption on the following 26 =
Earth months. If successful, the winning method will be integrated in =
the new tool helping operators of the Mars Express Orbiter to deliver =
science data for a longer period of time.
