KASA@ICSOC 2017: Second International Workshop on Knowledge Aware Service
Oriented Applications, KASA 2017, In conjunction with ICSOC 2017
Link: http://www.info.univ-tours.fr/kasa2017/

Service oriented computing is widely accepted for building interoperable,
dynamic and adaptive systems. However, in spite of the tremendous advances
and adoption, a considerable manual work is still required to align the
implementation of service-based systems with business and end-users
requirements.

Several efforts have been interested in bridging the gap between business
and end-users level on one hand and the implementation and technical layer
on the other hand. Initially driven by semantic Web technologies, the
proposed and emergent approaches adopt new techniques such as formal
concept analysis, information retrieval, social based recommendation,
natural language processing, and statistical analysis and mining.
Typically, these approaches abstract from/complement technical details and
focus on services and BP from a semantic and knowledge perspective. The
ultimate goal is managing service-oriented applications from a business and
semantic level.

The efforts made by both Semantic Web and SOA research communities have led
to the present SOA standards where ontologies and other formal frameworks
can be considered in several ways to improve SOA frameworks efficiency.
However, reaching the level of natively and fully semantic-aware SOA
frameworks is still a challenging task.

Moreover, the recent advances in Internet of Thing (IoT), which is leading
to a linked Web of resources, data, and services, a more global integration
of Linked Open Data (LOD) principles in SOA frameworks should be thought
for a high efficiency use and reuse of IoT data and resources.

The workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners
working in semantically enabled and knowledge aware service oriented
systems in order to present, discuss and share original research works and
practical experience.

Topics include but are not limited to:

Knowledge aware service oriented engineering
Service and BP representation and description: formal specification,
ontology based description
Services and BP indexation, discovery and composition: reasoning, formal
concept analysis, ontology based matchmaking information retrieval,
recommendation and social-based techniques
Service and BP variability management: configurable and reference models,
feature oriented development
Service and BP knowledge extraction: natural language processing, mining
and crowd sourcing techniques
Service and BP versioning and adaptation
Service and BP mining
Collections of services and BPs: organisation, visualisation and business
intelligence
Techniques for knowledge aware service oriented engineering: ontology
based, statistical analysis and mining techniques, natural language
processing, social and Human centric techniques, cloud computing
Knowledge aware service oriented engineering applied to related domains:
green IT, disaster management, e-health, e-government, smart home/cities,
sensor-based applications
Knowledge aware service oriented engineering in practice =E2=80=A2Ontologie=
s and
vocabularies for domain-specific services and BP
Surveys and empirical studies
Industrial and real use-cases
Semantic web Semantic web technologies for SOA IoT applications development
LOD principles for IoT services composition and linking

The workshop is soliciting both academic and industrial research
contributions, which have not been published elsewhere. Two types of papers
are accepted for submission:

Regular papers: should have a length of 14 pages and present mature work.
Short and position papers: should have a length of 6 pages and present work
in progress having an original idea behind.

Submitted papers must be written in English and formatted according to
Springer LNCS format (
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-6-793341-0). Papers mus=
t
be in PDF format and should be submitted electronically via the ConfTool
submission system following the url below.

http://www.conftool.com/icsoc2017

Authors must use this link and then, during the submission procedure,
select the Workshop on Knowledge Aware Service Oriented Applications.

Each paper will be reviewed by 3 distinct reviewers.

At least one author of each accepted paper should register for the workshop
program and attend to present the paper. This is a prerequisite for the
publication of the paper in the workshop proceedings.
