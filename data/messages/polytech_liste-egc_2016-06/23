Subject: [liste-egc] ESSLLI 2017 - Call for Course and Workshop Proposals


Call for Course and Workshop Proposals

29th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information - ESSLLI 2017
17-28 July, 2017, Toulouse, France


IMPORTANT DATES (with extended deadline)

  15 July 2016: Proposal submission deadline
  30 September 2016: Notification

SUBMISSION PORTAL
Please submit your proposals here:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2017


TOPICS AND FORMAT

Proposals for courses and workshops at ESSLLI 2017 are invited in all
areas of Logic, Linguistics and Computing Sciences. Cross-disciplinary
and innovative topics are particularly encouraged.

Each course and workshop will consist of five 90 minute sessions,
offered daily (Monday-Friday) in a single week. Proposals for two-week
courses should be structured and submitted as two independent one-week
courses, e.g. as an introductory course followed by an advanced one. In
such cases, the ESSLLI programme committee reserves the right to accept
just one of the two proposals.

All instructional and organizational work at ESSLLI is performed
completely on a voluntary basis, so as to keep participation fees to a
minimum. However, organizers and instructors have their registration
fees waived, and are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses up
to a level to be determined and communicated with the proposal
notification. ESSLLI can only guarantee reimbursement for at most one
course/workshop organizer, and can not guarantee full reimbursement of
travel costs for lecturers or organizers from outside of Europe. The
ESSLLI organizers would appreciate any help in controlling the School's
expenses by seeking complete coverage of travel and accommodation
expenses from other sources.

CATEGORIES

Each proposal should fall under one of the following categories.

* FOUNDATIONAL COURSES *
Such courses are designed to present the basics of a research area, to
people with no prior knowledge in that area. They should be of
elementary level, without prerequisites in the course's topic, though
possibly assuming a level of general scientific maturity in the relevant
discipline. They should enable researchers from related disciplines to
develop a level of comfort with the fundamental concepts and techniques
of the course's topic, thereby contributing to the interdisciplinary
nature of our research community.

* INTRODUCTORY COURSES *
Introductory courses are central to ESSLLI's mission. They are intended
to introduce a research field to students, young researchers, and other
non-specialists, and to foster a sound understanding of its basic
methods and techniques. Such courses should enable researchers from
related disciplines to develop some comfort and competence in the topic
considered. Introductory courses in a cross-disciplinary area may
presuppose general knowledge of the related disciplines.

* ADVANCED COURSES *
Advanced courses are targeted primarily to graduate students who wish to
acquire a level of comfort and understanding in the current research of
a field.

* WORKSHOPS *
Workshops focus on specialized topics, usually of current interest.
Workshops organizers are responsible for soliciting papers and selecting
the workshop programme. They are also responsible for publishing
proceedings if they decide to have proceedings.

PROPOSAL GUIDELINES

Course and workshop proposals should follow closely the following
guidelines to ensure full consideration.

Each course proposal can be submitted by no more than two instructors,
and each workshop by no more than two organizers. All instructors and
organizers must possess a PhD or equivalent degree by the submission
deadline.

Course proposals should mention explicitly the intended course category.
Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the intended level,
for example as it relates to standard textbooks and monographs in the
area. Proposals for advanced courses should specify the prerequisites in
detail.

Proposals must be submitted in PDF format via:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esslli2017

and include all of the following:

a. Personal information for each proposer: Name, affiliation, contact
    address, email, homepage (optional)

b. General proposal information: Title, category

c. Contents information:
    Abstract of up to 150 words
    Motivation and description (up to two pages)
    Tentative outline
    Expected level and prerequisites
    Appropriate references (e.g. textbooks, monographs, proceedings, surveys)

d. Practical information:
    Relevant preceding meetings and events, if applicable
    Potential external funding for participants
