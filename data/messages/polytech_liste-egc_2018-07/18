Subject: [liste-egc] Post-doctoral position : AI-based assistant for
 molecular QUantum chemistry

--000000000000d773110570b81bf2
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Duration : 1 year (with opportunity of extension)
Starts on fall 2018 (or until filled)
Location : Angers, France
Laboratory : LERIA - MOLTECH Anjou CNRS

Background : The topic of this project is artificial intelligence applied
to molecular computational chemistry. For the chemists, the ambition of
this project is to radically change the approach, developing artificial
intelligence and optimization methods in order to explore efficiently the
highly combinatorial molecular space. The recent abundance of data is an
incredible opportunity, but also an additional challenge and therefore an
added value to this project: we will develop original and highly scalable
methods.

Job Description : The postdoctoral researcher will start the machine
learning development based on already available DFT calculations databases.
Firstly, the goal of the predictive models is to generate for a new
uncalculated molecule, precise approximations for different important
results, saving hundreds hours of computation and making a broader
exploration of the molecular space feasible. In addition to predictive
models, generation of new molecules with constraints on one or more
characteristics (such as electronic energies, the number of synthesis
steps, etc.) will be investigated. We expect to study the integration of
neural networks (objective functions) with neighborhood algorithms
(molecular space exploration), but also emerging techniques like Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN).

Requirements : The candidate should therefore have experience in machine
learning or data sciences. Additional computational chemistry experience
will be appreciated. Fluency in Python language and solid knowledge of
machine learning algorithms is furthermore mandatory.
