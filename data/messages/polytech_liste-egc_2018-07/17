EKAW 2018 Call for Posters and Demos

The Demos and Posters session at EKAW 2018 aims to complement the 
research track by providing an opportunity to present and discuss 
late-breaking results, on-going projects and innovative prototypes. The 
informal setting of the P&D session encourages presenters and 
participants to engage in discussions about the presented work. Such 
discussions can be invaluable inputs for the future work of the 
presenters, while offering participants an effective way to broaden 
their knowledge of the emerging research trends and to start 
collaborations with other researchers.

We invite submissions relevant to the area of knowledge management, 
knowledge representation, engineering and acquisition, and knowledge in 
use; paying special attention to the EKAW 2018 focus on Knowledge 
Engineering & Management and Artificial Intelligence. Technical posters, 
reports on software systems, descriptions of completed work, and work in 
progress are all welcome.

Demonstrations are intended to showcase innovative knowledge engineering 
related implementations and technologies. All submissions are intended 
to convey a scientific result or work in progress and should not be 
advertisements for commercial software packages.

Verlag LNCS formatting guidelines. Papers will be published in digital 
proceedings, possibly CEUR.

All papers will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.

significance of the contribution are ensured.

Please make sure that it is clear how the demo or poster fits with the 
topics of interest of EKAW 2018. Authors submitting a demo are strongly

of the application to be presented. They should also make clear what 
exactly will be demonstrated to the participants (e.g., what datasets 
will be used, which functionalities will be showed).

At least one of the authors must be a registered participant at the 
conference, and present the work at the Demos and Posters Session.
