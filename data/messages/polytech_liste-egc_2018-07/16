Objective and content of the workshop
-------------------------------------
In this workshop, we will share and discuss good practices for the
successful implementation of a FabSpace. A FabSpace is a place at the
University where students, companies, researchers, experts, civil
society, and public authorities meet, to develop novel application ideas
based on Earth Observation data for various disciplines and technology
fields. A specific attention will be given to local environmental
management applications.
Based on the feedback from the six founding FabSpaces within the
FabSpace 2.0 project (which received funding from the European Union’s
Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under the Grant Agreement
n°693210), and by closely monitoring the operations and experiences of
the fourteen new FabSpaces, the objectives of this workshop through the
proposed brainstorming sessions are:
- Define the methods to establish universities as the heart of
innovation 2.0 and local points of reference for the use of Earth
Observation data for decision-making on local issues;
- Find new initiatives to develop the FabSpace 2.0 concept worldwide.

Call for communications and papers
----------------------------------
The workshop will be organized around presentation (call for
communication is open) and round tables. After the workshop, we will
publish a CEUR-WS volume on the contributions. Contributions can be use
cases, best practices, description of pedagogical innovations using
Earth observation data. The submitted papers will follow the LNCS
format, 4-6 pages for short papers, 10-20 pages for long papers. The
proceedings will be published after the conference and will include a
white paper on the results of the workshop.
Submissions (communications, papers) should be uploaded on easychair:
