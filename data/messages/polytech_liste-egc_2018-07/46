Apologies for cross postings.

Please consider contributing to the SIS-IoT 2018 workshop, held as a part
of the 8th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IoT 2018):

2nd International Workshop on Semantic Interoperability and Standardization
in the IoT (SIS-IoT 2018)

Santa-Barbara, California, 15th October 2018

WWW: https://iot2018wt.github.io/sis-iot/
E-mail: iot-sisiot2018@easychair.org

The main objective of this workshop is to bring SDOs and industrial
practitioners in IoT with an interest in semantic interoperability together
with the strong and successful research community at IoT 2018 to discuss
current trends and challenges in Semantic Interoperability and
Standardization in IoT.

Semantic technology and linked data are perceived by the IoT industry as
beneficial technologies to enable semantic interoperability in the
fragmented landscape of IoT ecosystems and platforms. However, most
industrial practitioners are not familiar with these technologies and are
not willing to learn them, as they believe the learning curve is too steep.
IoT developers - whether device manufacturers or application developers -
ask for rather simple ontologies that are easy to use, and clear guidelines
on how to implement semantic web/ linked data solutions, possibly supported
by standards development organizations (SDOs), whereas the information they
can currently find on the Internet is overwhelming and perceived as not
directly applicable. As we have often heard from industrial stakeholders in
the past years, there is a clear need to bring semantic technology out of
the research labs - where it has been successful so far - to be adopted and
applied in operational environments by the IoT industry. Semantic
Interoperability is a key issue on the Internet of Things, and several
organizations develop ontologies to describe IoT devices and the data they
exchange. (W3C SSN, W3C WoT, ETSI SmartM2M, ETSI ISG CIM, BAC.net, KNX,
BRICK, =E2=80=A6). We encourage these organizations to submit papers about =
their
work.

The SIS-IoT workshop will be a half-day event with short and full papers,
openly peer-reviewed on EasyChair. The event is meant to be highly
interactive, so as to facilitate discussions among participants that could
result in future collaborative work. A keynote/invited talk will be
planned, and followed by authors presenting their paper. We will ensure
sufficient time will be dedicated to questions and answers for each paper.
The session will end with a general discussion session to discuss
experience related to the topics of the workshop. A panel with experts from
the research community and industrial stakeholders may be planned.

Relevant topics of interest include the development and use of (ontology)
standards for solving semantic interoperability issues along the following
lines:


- Cross-cutting IoT semantic interoperability approaches reusing standards
- Use cases and implementations from pilots, innovation and research
projects
- Current trends in standardization bodies related to IoT
- IoT standardization in vertical sectors (Smart Cities, Industrial
Applications, Ageing Well, Smart Agriculture, Smart Energy, Wearables,
Smart Appliances, Cooperative and Connected Mobility, etc.)
- REST-like and RESTful architectural styles for applications involving
constrained devices
- Alignment of ontology standards among standardization bodies
- Solutions for machine-to-machine semantic interoperability
- Open source implementations of standards for semantic interoperability
- Interoperability and alignment among standards, ontologies, catalogues,
related to sensors, actuators, and the web of things
- Semantic standards for Web of Data and Things
- Semantic standards for constructing systems of IoT Systems
