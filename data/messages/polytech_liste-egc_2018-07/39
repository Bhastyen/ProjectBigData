Subject: [liste-egc] 3-year fully funded PhD position in the research area
 of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

3-year fully funded PhD position in the research area of Big Data and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in collaboration of the MIDI team of the
ETIS Lab UMR 8051, Paris, France and the Department of Computer Science,
University of Warwick under the supervision of Professor Dimitris
Kotzinos and Professor Peter Triantifillou respectively.
(PhD funded under the Paris Seine Initiative of Excellence)

Scope and Context
Due to the massive amounts of available data, various critical database
tasks, e.g. query answering, become more of an approximate task than an
exact one. On the other hand, the functioning of many critical Big Data
system components depends on monitoring and predictions: e.g. in caching
subsystems (which items to cache/prefetch), in query optimisation (the
best access method to use), in indexing (when and for which attributes
to build indexes). Additionally, big data analytics=C3=95 systems need to=
 be
able to decide on the fly the most suitable (e.g. matching or
optimization) algorithms to use in different cases. Similarly, many
different prediction models for analytical queries (e.g., regression
models) may perform differently for different predictive analytics
tasks, so the system must decide on the best model to use. These
problems can be approached by the use of predictive modelling adaptation
techniques, well established in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine
Learning (ML). So, we propose to focus on working towards extending
current Big Data management and analysis systems with ML and AI-based:
* Approximate analytical query processing engines based on ML models -
e.g., queries based on descriptive statistics (COUNT, AVG, SUM, etc.) or
on dependence statistics (CORR, CoVar, regressions, etc.). Given the
massiveness of the current datasets, approximate query answering is one
of the solutions we can employ in order to get responses in reasonable
time and provide at the same time error feedback and control. At the
same time, we want to introduce into the system uncertainty models with
guarantees of maximum error and an understanding of the trade-off error
vs time/costs during query processing.
* Self-learning capabilities, big data management and analysis systems
should be able to learn by monitoring operations and decisions made so
far and use them to extract useful information in order to optimize
various of the system=C3=95s operation, like selecting the best possible
algorithms, models, etc.
So, during this PhD we want to investigate the above issues and develop
solutions that can be integrated to real world big data management system=
s.

We expect the successful applicant to be one of the driving forces
behind the newly established collaboration between the two entities
mentioned above. The successful applicant will work jointly with
Professor Dimitris Kotzinos (ETIS / Paris Seine University) and
Professor Peter Triantafillou (Department of Computer Science,
University of Warwick) and their respective groups, will be based at
ETIS lab at the University of Cergy Pontoise in the greater Paris area
but frequent exchanges and stays at Warwick are envisioned.

Tentative Starting Date: October 2018

Application
If interested, please send your application (including a detailed CV,
university transcripts, a copy of the master thesis and/or scientific
papers if available, as well as a list of personal references and a
motivation letter) in PDF format to Professor Dimitris Kotzinos
