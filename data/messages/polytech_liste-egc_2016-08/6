          <h3>IMPORTANT DATES</h3>
          Demo track submission: 15 August 2016<br>
          <br>
          Notification of acceptance: 22 August 2016<br>
          <br>
          Camera ready: 1 September 2016<br>
          <br>
          Workshop: 28 October 2016<br>
          <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
          <p>The amount of structured content published on the Web has
            been growing rapidly, making it possible to address
            increasingly complex information access tasks. Recent years
            have witnessed the emergence of large scale human-curated
            knowledge bases as well as a growing array of techniques
            that identify or extract information automatically from
            unstructured and semi-structured sources. The ESAIR workshop
            series aims to advance the general research agenda on the
            problem of creating and exploiting semantic annotations. The
            ninth edition of ESAIR sets its focus on <strong>personal
              mobile applications</strong>. The desired result of the
            workshop is a roadmap and research agenda that guides
            academic efforts and aligns them with industrial directions
            and developments.</p>
          <h3>SCOPE AND TOPICS</h3>
          <p>The continuing goal of the ESAIR workshop series is to
            create a forum for researchers interested in the application
            of semantic annotations for information access tasks.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>ESAIR ’16 aims at shifting researchers’ focus to
                new opportunities in exploiting semantic annotations for
                personal mobile applications. </strong></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Mobile usage is on the rise and now accounts for 60% of
            total time spent on digital media platforms; even more
            interestingly, mobile apps alone account for 51% of total
            time spent on digital media [<a moz-do-not-send="true"

              target="_blank">1</a>]. We are looking for different use
            cases of semantic annotations to enhance information
            retrieval tasks on personal applications, such as: personal
            assistants, personal tracking and general information
            seeking applications on mobile platforms. One main question
            we seek to answer is the types of semantic annotations
            needed for such use cases. Another important issue on our
            agenda is the (un)availability of large-scale (personal)
            data for (academic) research.<br>
            This year we will continue with our demo track with a
            primary focus on personal applications. We invite
            researchers and practitioners to present their innovative
            prototypes in a dedicated demo track at the workshop.</p>
          <p>Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
