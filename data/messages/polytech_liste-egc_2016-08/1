*GUIDO CALDARELLI: Instability in financial networks*



Following the financial crisis of 2007-2008, a deep analogy between the
origins of instability in financial systems and in complex ecosystems has
been pointed out: in both cases, topological features of network structures
influence how easy it is for distress to spread within the system. However,
in financial network models, the intricate details of how financial
institutions interact typically play a decisive role. Hence, a general
understanding of precisely how network topology creates instability remains
lacking. Here we show how processes that are widely believed to stabilise
the financial system, i.e.market integration and diversification, can
actually drive it towards instability, as they contribute to create
cyclical structures which tend to amplify financial distress, thereby
undermining systemic stability and making large crises more likely. This
result holds irrespective of the precise details of how institutions
interact, and demonstrates that policy-relevant analysis of the factors
affecting financial stability can be carried out while abstracting away
from such details.

Complex Systems Society.*







*Raissa D'SOUZA : Steering and controlling systems of interdependent
networks*



Networks are at the core of modern society, spanning physical, biological
and social systems. Each distinct network is typically a complex system,
shaped by the collective action of individual agents and displaying
emergent behaviors. Moreover, collections of these complex networks often
interact and depend upon one another, which can lead to unanticipated
consequences such as cascading failures and novel phase transitions. Simple
mathematical models of networks can provide important insights into such
phenomena. Here we will cover several such models, beginning with control
of phase transitions in an individual network then moving on to modeling
phenomena in coupled networks, including cascading failures and optimal
interdependence.

*Renaud LAMBIOTTE: Burstiness and spreading on networks: models and
predictions*



When modelling dynamical systems on networks, it is often assumed that the
process is Markovian, that is future states depend only upon the present
state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. Examples include
diffusion of ideas or diseases on social networks, or synchronisation of
interacting dynamical units. In each case, the dynamics is governed by
coupled differential equation, where the coupling is defined by the
adjacency matrix of the underlying network. The main purpose of this talk
is to challenge this Markovian picture. We will argue that non-Markovian
models can provide a more realistic picture in the case of temporal
networks where edges change in time, or in situations when pathways can be
measured empirically. We will focus on the importance of non-Poisson
temporal statistics, and show analytically the impact of burstiness on
diffusive dynamics, before turning to applications and incorporating memory
kernels in predictive models of retweet dynamics.


*After a PhD in Physics at ULB, and Post-docs at ULg, UCLouvain and
Imperial College, he is currently associate professor in the Department of

*Yamir MORENO: On the structure and dynamics of multilayer networks
<http://complexnetworks.org/#collapse6>*



The availability of highly detailed data of real-world systems have allowed
to study systems that are made up of multiple layers. In this talk, we will
revise recent advances on the topic of multilayer networked systems. First,
we will discuss how to represent these networks and what kind of metrics
are needed to capture the new topological complexity arising from the
interdependency of the layers. Secondly, we will also study contagion
processes on these topologies and present results regarding the interplay
between the critical properties of the system and its structural scales. To
summarize, we will discuss possible future directions in this new, but very
active field of research

Eiko Yoneki: Efficient Large-Scale Graph Processing



The emergence of big data requires fundamental new methodology for data
analysis, processing, and information extraction. The main challenge here
is to perform efficient and robust data processing, while adapting to the
underlying resource availability in a dynamic, large-scale computing
environment. I would introduce our recent work on the graph processing that
have billion-scale of vertices and edges in a commodity single computer,
which requires secondary storage as external memory. Executing algorithms
results in access to such secondary storage and performance of I/O takes an
important role, regardless of the algorithmic complexity or runtime
efficiency of the actual algorithm in use.

University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. She leads a group called =E2=
=80=98data
centric systems and networking=E2=80=99, where current research focuses on =
the
exploration of new abstractions for supporting the design and
implementation of robust and heterogeneous large-scale data processing.

*TUTORIALS : NOVEMBER 29, 2016*



*ERNESTO ESTRADA: Consensus dynamics on networks. Theory and applications*



Consensus is well documented across the social sciences, with examples
ranging from behavioral flocking in popular cultural styles, emotional
contagion, collective decision making, pedestrians=E2=80=99 walking behavio=
r, and
others. We can model consensus in a social group by encoding the state of
each individual at a given time in a vector. The group reaches consensus at
when the difference in the =E2=80=9Copinions=E2=80=9D for every pair of ind=
ividuals is
asymptotically zero, and the collective dynamics of the system is modeled
by a diffusion equation dominated by the graph Laplacian. Decisions in
groups trying to reach consensus are frequently influenced by a small
proportion of the group who guides or dictates the behavior of the entire
network. In this situation a group of leaders indicates and/or initiates
the route to the consensus, and the rest of the group readily follows their
attitudes. The study of leadership in social groups has always intrigued
researchers in the social and behavioral sciences. Specifically, the way in
which leaders emerge in social groups is not well understood. Leaders may
emerge either randomly in response to particular historical circumstances
or from the individual having the most prominent position (centrality) in
the social network at any time. In this tutorial I will introduce the
theoretical model of consensus in a network, for the general case of
undirected as well as directed ones. First, I will introduce the
mathematical concepts of the model, and show when in every case there is a
consensus in the network. I will also introduce some properties of the
Laplacian matrix for networks that will help to understand the main results
of the model. Then, I will introduce a controllability problem and its
solution in networks consisting of leaders and followers. Following this
initial part I will how to use Matlab to model a consensus process in a
given network (codes will be provided to participants). At this point I
will motive the necessity of considering the indirect influence of peers
apart from the direct peers pressure. In mathematical terms I will make a
generalization of the Laplacian matrix on graphs to consider the k-path
Laplacians and their transform. Using this transformed k-path Laplacians I
will show how to study a few interesting topics on networks, such as the
controllability of networks, the selection of leaders, the diffusion of
innovations under direct+indirect peers pressure. Finally, I will prove and
illustrate how the consensus and diffusion of innovations can be
superdiffusive or ballistic in complex networks under the effect of direct
and indirect peers pressure. Some examples, such as diffusion of methods
among high schools or the adoption of a biotechnological product among
farmers will be used in the tutorial.

*Bruno GONCALVES: A practical introduction to Machine Learning (with
Python)*



The data deluge we currently witnessing presents both opportunities and
challenges. Never before have so many aspects of our world been so
thoroughly quantified as now and never before has data been so plentiful.
On the other hand, the complexity of the analyses required to extract
useful information from these piles of data is also rapidly increasing
rendering more traditional and simpler approaches simply unfeasible or
unable to provide new insights.


In this tutorial we provide a practical introduction to some of the most
important algorithms of machine learning that are relevant to the field of
Complex Networks in general, with a particular emphasis on the analysis and
modeling of empirical data. The goal is to provide the fundamental concepts
necessary to make sense of the more sophisticated data analysis approaches
that are currently appearing in the literature and to provide a field guide
to the advantages an disadvantages of each algorithm.
In particular, we will cover unsupervised learning algorithms such as
K-means, Expectation-Maximization, and supervised ones like Support Vector
Machines, Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Participants are expected to
have a basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra as well as
working proficiency with the Python programming language.

the financial crisis of 2007-2008, a deep analogy between the origins of
instability in financial systems and in complex ecosystems has been pointed
out: in both cases, topological features of network structures influence ho=
w
easy it is for distress to spread within the system. However, in financial
network models, the intricate details of how financial institutions interac=
t
typically play a decisive role. Hence, a general understanding of precisely=
 how
network topology creates instability remains lacking. Here we show how
processes that are widely believed to stabilise the financial system,
i.e.market integration and diversification, can actually drive it towards
instability, as they contribute to create cyclical structures which tend to
amplify financial distress, thereby undermining systemic stability and maki=
ng
large crises more likely. This result holds irrespective of the precise det=
ails
of how institutions interact, and demonstrates that policy-relevant analysi=
s of
the factors affecting financial stability can be carried out while abstract=
ing
away from such details.</span></p>

are at the core of modern society, spanning physical, biological and social
systems. Each distinct network is typically a complex system, shaped by the
collective action of individual agents and displaying emergent behaviors.
Moreover, collections of these complex networks often interact and depend u=
pon
one another, which can lead to unanticipated consequences such as cascading
failures and novel phase transitions. Simple mathematical models of network=
s
can provide important insights into such phenomena. Here we will cover seve=

such models, beginning with control of phase transitions in an individual

cascading failures and optimal interdependence.</span></p>

networks, it is often assumed that the process is Markovian, that is future
states depend only upon the present state and not on the sequence of events
that preceded it. Examples include diffusion of ideas or diseases on social
networks, or synchronisation of interacting dynamical units. In each case, =
the
dynamics is governed by coupled differential equation, where the coupling i=
s
defined by the adjacency matrix of the underlying network. The main purpose=
 of
this talk is to challenge this Markovian picture. We will argue that
non-Markovian models can provide a more realistic picture in the case of
temporal networks where edges change in time, or in situations when pathway=
s
can be measured empirically. We will focus on the importance of non-Poisson
temporal statistics, and show analytically the impact of burstiness on
diffusive dynamics, before turning to applications and incorporating memory
kernels in predictive models of retweet dynamics.</span></p>

is well documented across the social sciences, with examples ranging from
behavioral flocking in popular cultural styles, emotional contagion, collec=
tive
decision making, pedestrians=E2=80=99 walking behavior, and others. We can =
model
consensus in a social group by encoding the state of each individual at a g=
iven
time in a vector. The group reaches consensus at when the difference in the
=E2=80=9Copinions=E2=80=9D for every pair of individuals is asymptotically =
zero, and the
collective dynamics of the system is modeled by a diffusion equation domina=
ted
by the graph Laplacian. Decisions in groups trying to reach consensus are
frequently influenced by a small proportion of the group who guides or dict=
ates
the behavior of the entire network. In this situation a group of leaders
indicates and/or initiates the route to the consensus, and the rest of the
group readily follows their attitudes. The study of leadership in social gr=
oups
has always intrigued researchers in the social and behavioral sciences.
Specifically, the way in which leaders emerge in social groups is not well
understood. Leaders may emerge either randomly in response to particular
historical circumstances or from the individual having the most prominent
position (centrality) in the social network at any time. In this tutorial I
will introduce the theoretical model of consensus in a network, for the gen=
eral
case of undirected as well as directed ones. First, I will introduce the
mathematical concepts of the model, and show when in every case there is a
consensus in the network. I will also introduce some properties of the
Laplacian matrix for networks that will help to understand the main results=
 of
the model. Then, I will introduce a controllability problem and its solutio=
n in
networks consisting of leaders and followers. Following this initial part I
will how to use Matlab to model a consensus process in a given network (cod=
es
will be provided to participants). At this point I will motive the necessit=
y of
considering the indirect influence of peers apart from the direct peers
pressure. In mathematical terms I will make a generalization of the Laplaci=
an
matrix on graphs to consider the k-path Laplacians and their transform. Usi=
ng
this transformed k-path Laplacians I will show how to study a few interesti=
ng
topics on networks, such as the controllability of networks, the selection =
of
leaders, the diffusion of innovations under direct+indirect peers pressure.
Finally, I will prove and illustrate how the consensus and diffusion of
innovations can be superdiffusive or ballistic in complex networks under th=
e
effect of direct and indirect peers pressure. Some examples, such as diffus=
ion
of methods among high schools or the adoption of a biotechnological product
among farmers will be used in the tutorial.</span><span lang=3D"EN-GB" styl=

deluge we currently witnessing presents both opportunities and challenges.
Never before have so many aspects of our world been so thoroughly quantifie=
d as
now and never before has data been so plentiful. On the other hand, the
complexity of the analyses required to extract useful information from thes=
e
piles of data is also rapidly increasing rendering more traditional and sim=
pler
approaches simply unfeasible or unable to provide new insights.</span></p>

In this tutorial we provide a practical introduction to some of the most
important algorithms of machine learning that are relevant to the field of
Complex Networks in general, with a particular emphasis on the analysis and
modeling of empirical data. The goal is to provide the fundamental concepts
necessary to make sense of the more sophisticated data analysis approaches =
that
are currently appearing in the literature and to provide a field guide to t=
he
advantages an disadvantages of each algorithm.<br>
In particular, we will cover unsupervised learning algorithms such as K-mea=
ns,
Expectation-Maximization, and supervised ones like Support Vector Machines,
Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Participants are expected to have a basi=
c
understanding of calculus and linear algebra as well as working proficiency
with the Python programming language.</span></p>

tenured faculty position at Aix-Marseille Universit=C3=A9. He has a strong =
expertise
in using large scale datasets for the analysis of human behavior. After
completing his joint PhD in Physics, MSc in C.S. at Emory University in
Atlanta, GA in 2008 he joined the Center for Complex Networks and Systems
Research at Indiana University as a Research Associate. From September 2011
until August 2012 he was an Associate Research Scientist at the Laboratory =
for
the Modeling of Biological and Technical Systems at Northeastern University=
.
Since 2008 he has been pursuing the use of Data Science and Machine Learnin=
g to
study human behavior. By processing and analyzing large datasets from Twitt=
er,
Wikipedia, web access logs, and Yahoo! Meme he studied how we can observe b=
oth
large scale and individual human behavior in an obtrusive and widespread
manner. The main applications have been to the study of Computational
Linguistics, Information Diffusion, Behavioral Change and Epidemic Spreadin=
g.
He is the author of 60+ publications with over 3800+ Google Scholar citatio=
