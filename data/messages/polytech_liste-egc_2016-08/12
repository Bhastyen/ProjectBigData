Subject: [liste-egc] Preliminary call for papers DOLAP 2017 @ EDBT

DOLAP 2017
19th International Workshop On Design, Optimization, Languages and 
Analytical Processing of Big Data
(Colocated with EDBT 2017)
http://www.info.univ-tours.fr/~marcel/dolap2017


During the last eighteen years, DOLAP has been established as one of the 
reference places for researchers to publish their work in the area of 
data warehousing and OLAP and maintains a high quality of accepted 
papers. DOLAP 2017 ambitions to be a venue where novel ideas around new 
landscapes of business intelligence and big data are fostered and 
nurtured and new exiting results are produced, in an attempt to build a 
strong, vibrant community around these areas.


Important dates
* Workshop paper submission deadline: November 14, 2016
* Workshop paper notification: December 20, 2016
* Workshop paper camera-ready: January 15, 2017
* Workshop: March 21, 2017


DOLAP accepts short and long paper submissions. The page limit is 10 
pages for full papers and 5 pages for short papers (in ACM format). 
Papers should be submitted in PDF format via Easychair 
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dolap2017). The proceedings of 
the workshop will be published online as a volume of the CEUR Workshop 
Proceedings. A selection of the best long papers will be recommended for 
inclusion in a special issue of a reputed international journal.

Long papers include novel, unpublished and mature research, industrial 
or survey work. Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might 
be accepted to the workshop as short papers. Short papers include:
* On-going: novel research works with preliminary results.
* Vision: position papers outlining research issues for future work.
* PhD: single-authored submissions from PhD students at the early stages 
of their PhD studies, describing the problem focused on, its importance, 
why existing solutions are not sufficient, and outlining of the novel 
contribution envisioned.
* Demonstrations: they will enjoy a presentation in the main sessions, 
not as a separate "interactive" session. The authors will be asked to 
prepare a recorded video that shows the system functionality and a few 
slides to present main features, architecture and research behind.


Research topics include, but are not limited to:

Design and Language
* Data warehousing fundamentals: architectures, modeling, design, data 
extraction, cleaning, and loading (ETL), multidimensional modeling and 
queries, maintenance, evolution, security, personalization and privacy 
in data warehouses, etc.,
* Warehousing and Variety: unstructured data (e.g., text), 
semi-structured data (e.g., XML), multimedia, spatial, temporal, and 
spatio-temporal data warehouses, stream and sensor data, semantic Web & 
Deep Web in Data warehouses, Data lakes, etc.

Optimization
* Coping with Volume: physical organization of data warehouses, 
performance optimization and tuning, scalability of DW, MapReduce in 
Data warehouses, etc.,
* Coping with Velocity: DW deployment on Parallel machine, Database 
Clusters, Cloud, smart Grid, etc., Active/Real-Time analytics & data 
warehouses, real-time queries, etc.

Analytical Processing and applications
* Analytics and Value: OLAP Exploration through visualization, 
recommendation, reformulation, approximate query-answering, 
personalization, result presentation, data storytelling, advanced 
visualization for business contexts, etc.,
* Analytics and Veracity: quality aspects of OLAP analysis, of 
exploration outcome and end-user experience, fairness of data analysis, 
analytics and data driven decision making for the data enthusiasts, etc.,
* Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, 
information retrieval, search engines, etc.
* Big Data applications: smart city, smart health, etc.
