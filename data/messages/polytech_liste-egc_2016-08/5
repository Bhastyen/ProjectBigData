9th Workshop on

Exploiting Semantic Annotations for Information Retrieval (ESAIR’16)

in conjunction with CIKM 2016

CALL FOR DEMOS

http://www.esair.org/

28 October 2016, Indianapolis, USA
=======================================================


      IMPORTANT DATES

Demo track submission: 15 August 2016

Notification of acceptance: 22 August 2016

Camera ready: 1 September 2016

Workshop: 28 October 2016


      OVERVIEW

The amount of structured content published on the Web has been growing 
rapidly, making it possible to address increasingly complex information 
access tasks. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large scale 
human-curated knowledge bases as well as a growing array of techniques 
that identify or extract information automatically from unstructured and 
semi-structured sources. The ESAIR workshop series aims to advance the 
general research agenda on the problem of creating and exploiting 
semantic annotations. The ninth edition of ESAIR sets its focus on 
*personal mobile applications*. The desired result of the workshop is a 
roadmap and research agenda that guides academic efforts and aligns them 
with industrial directions and developments.


      SCOPE AND TOPICS

The continuing goal of the ESAIR workshop series is to create a forum 
for researchers interested in the application of semantic annotations 
for information access tasks.

    *ESAIR ’16 aims at shifting researchers’ focus to new opportunities
    in exploiting semantic annotations for personal mobile applications. *

Mobile usage is on the rise and now accounts for 60% of total time spent 
on digital media platforms; even more interestingly, mobile apps alone 
account for 51% of total time spent on digital media [1 
<https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Ma%20jor-Mobile-%20Milestones-in-May-Apps-Now-Drive-Half-of-All-Time-%20Spent-on-Digital>]. 
We are looking for different use cases of semantic annotations to 
enhance information retrieval tasks on personal applications, such as: 
personal assistants, personal tracking and general information seeking 
applications on mobile platforms. One main question we seek to answer is 
the types of semantic annotations needed for such use cases. Another 
important issue on our agenda is the (un)availability of large-scale 
(personal) data for (academic) research.
This year we will continue with our demo track with a primary focus on 
personal applications. We invite researchers and practitioners to 
present their innovative prototypes in a dedicated demo track at the 
workshop.

Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

  * Applications and use cases
      o What are use cases that make obvious the need for semantic
        annotation of information?
      o What tasks cannot be solved by traditional (bag-of-words)
        retrieval approaches?
  * Annotations
      o What types of annotation are available and what is missing?
      o Are there crucial differences between human and
        machine-generated annotations?
      o How should we deal with the uncertainty of annotations?
  * User interfaces and interaction
      o How to aid users in articulating powerful queries (beyond a few
        keywords)?
      o How to present results and interact with users in an
        intelligible way (esp. on mobile devices)?
  * Evaluation
      o How to evaluate semantic annotations (component-based vs.
        end-to-end)?
      o How to make interesting and large-scale real-world data
        available for academic research (esp. for personal mobile
        applications)?


      SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

All submissions must be formatted according to the ACM SIG proceedings 
format (option 2).

The reviewing process is single-blind, so submissions do not need to be 
anonymized. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to 
present their work at the workshop.

Please submit your paper through the submission website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esair16


        Demo papers

We invite researchers and practitioners to present their innovative 
prototypes in a dedicated demo track at the workshop. Demo submissions 
must be based on an implemented system that pursues one or more aspects 
relevant to the interest areas of the workshop.

  * Submission deadline: 15 August, 2016
  * Acceptance notification: 22 August, 2016
  * Camera-ready version: 1 September, 2016
