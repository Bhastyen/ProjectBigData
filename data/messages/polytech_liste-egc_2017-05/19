---- AIMS AND TOPICS

Environmental and more generally geo-spatial information is now provided =
by crowdsourcing but also by public administrations in the context of =
the open data policies. Analyses of such data are still challenging. =
Firstly because of their heterogeneity (structural, semantic, spatial =
and temporal), and secondly because of the difficulty in choosing the =
=93best=94 knowledge discovery process to apply, according to the needs =
of the experts in the field. This special issue aims to provide high =
quality research covering all or part of the challenges mentioned above, =
from a theoretical or experimental point of view.

Challenge about data science deals with creation, storage, search, =
sharing, modeling, analysis, and visualization of data, information, and =
knowledge. In Data Science context, spatio-temporal aspects are crucial =
in order to manage and mine data, to index and retrieve information, and =
finally to discover and visualize knowledge. By taking into account =
these spatio-temporal aspects, original methods have to be proposed for =
processing real and complex data from different domains, e.g., =
environment, agriculture, health, urban, and so forth.=20

Topics:=20
- Pre and post processing of environmental and agriculture data
- Geographical information retrieval
- Spatial data mining and spatial data warehousing
- Knowledge discovery use-cases dedicated to environmental data
- Spatial text mining
- Spatial ontology
- Spatial recommendations and personalization
- Visual analytics for geospatial data
- Dedicated applications:
 * Spatio-temporal analytics platform
 * Agricultural Decision Support Systems
 * Urban traffic systems
 * Trajectory analysis
 * Land-use and urban policies
 * Land-use and urban planning analysis
 * Spatio-temporal analysis in Ecology and Agriculture
 * and so forth

---- SUBMISSION WEBSITE:
=20
The submissions Web site for DSAA 2017 Special Sessions is Easy Chair =
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ddsaa2017) that is the same as =
the submission Web site for the main conference track. =20
=20
---- IMPORTANT DATES:
=20
Special Session Paper Submission: May 25, 2017
Notification of acceptance: July 25, 2017
Camera-Ready: Aug 15, 2017
Advanced Registration: Aug. 31, 2017
=20
---- PUBLICATIONS:
=20
Special session papers follow the same format as the conference papers. =
The paper length allowed is a maximum of ten (10) pages, in 2-column =
U.S. letter style using IEEE Conference template (see the IEEE =
Proceedings Author Guidelines: =
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.ht=
ml).

All submissions will be blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the =
basis of technical quality, relevance to conference topics of interest, =
originality, significance, and clarity. Author names and affiliations =
must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be =
adjusted to preserve author anonymity.=20

All accepted papers, including main tracks and special sessions, will be =
published by IEEE and will be submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore =
Digital Library. The conference proceedings will be submitted for EI =
indexing through INSPEC by IEEE. Top quality papers accepted and =
presented at the conference will be selected for extension and invited =
to the special issues of International Journal of Data Science and =
Analytics (JDSA, Springer).=20
