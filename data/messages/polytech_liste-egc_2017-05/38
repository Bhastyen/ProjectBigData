CALL FOR PAPERS

During the past years, sensing technologies have become an important field
for computer science and technologies as seen in the trend of cyber
physical system (CPS), machine-to-machine (M2M) systems, and the Internet
of Things (IoT). Researchers in sensing technologies provide technological
means to capture environmental, technical, physiological and other data.
They provide the raw material on which applications and services will be
built. Sensor data are the basis for the smart world. Due to various
characteristics of sensor data and their corresponding processing
requirements, such as multisource, heterogeneous, real-time, voluminous,
continuous, streaming, ever-expanding and spatio-temporal, many traditional
data processing and integration approaches begin to show their limitations,
particularly when dealing with situations like sensor data and its
application deluge.

Streaming data analysis, knowledge extraction (data mining, machine
learning) and complex event processing are required to treat and preprocess
these data, to detect correlations in data and to discover patterns or
abnormalities in dynamically evolving situations. Data files as well as
data streams need to be treated, variety of representation are used
depending on the Web-based systems and the means for handling, storing and
accessing this information to make valuable decisions need to be studied.
Semantic web technologies have provided particle means to this aim. Social
applications, ubiquitous and pervasive computing are examples of areas
making use of semantised sensed or processed data. Semantisation, privacy,
trust, context awareness, community management, and data visualization are
the core issues related to this area. We aim to bring together topics from
several layers of data processing; from devices to services to enable novel
ideas and collaboration combining the information from multiple sources.
The workshop intends to provide a forum for exchange of experiences among
researchers from industry and academia actively involved in research,
development and evaluation of new concepts, theoretical methods and
experimental characterization and for debating different innovative
solutions. Practitioners involved in applications domains are also welcome
to present their tasks and to participate to these discussions. The
workshop will feature a selective technical program consisting of regular
research papers as well as position talks.

This workshop is continuation of International Workshop of Web Intelligence
and Smart Sensing Systems (IWWISS=E2=80=9914,=E2=80=9915, and IWSSS=E2=80=
=9916). The name of the
workshop is changed to focus more on system aspects.

We invite authors to submit original research as well as review articles,
posters and demos to present latest progresses, determine future goals, and
show techniques for future development in the field.
