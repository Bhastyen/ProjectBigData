Subject: [liste-egc] ECML Workshop - Interactive Adaptive Learning

ECML Workshop - Interactive Adaptive Learning

http://mandos.ies.uni-kassel.de/ial2017/

This workshop aims at discussing techniques and approaches for 
optimising the whole learning process, including the interaction with 
human supervisors, processing systems, and includes adaptive, active, 
semi-supervised, and transfer learning techniques, and combinations 
thereof in interactive and adaptive machine learning systems. Our 
objective is to bridge the communities researching and developing these 
techniques and systems in machine learning and data mining. Therefore we 
welcome contributions that present a novel problem setting, propose a 
novel approach, or report experience with the practical deployment of 
such a system and raise unsolved questions to the research community
