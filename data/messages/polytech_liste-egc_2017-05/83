Call for Papers:
IJCAI 2017 workshop on Advances in Bioinformatics and Artificial
Intelligence: Bridging the Gap
http://bioinfo.uqam.ca/IJCAI_BAI2017/
August 21, 2017
Melbourne, Australia


The aim of this workshop called Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence
(BAI) is to bring together active scholars and practitioners in the
frontier of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Bioinformatics. AI holds a
tremendous repertoire of algorithms and methods that constitute the core of
different topics of bioinformatics and computational biology research. BAI
goals are two folds : How can AI techniques contribute to bioinformatics
research ?, and How can bioinformatics research raise new fundamental
questions in AI ? Contributions will clearly point out answers to one of
these goals focusing on AI techniques as well as focusing on biological
problems.

Aims and Scope:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly important role in
the analysis of sequence, structure and functional patterns or models from
sequence databases. Bioinformatics aims to store, organize, explore,
extract, analyze, interpret, and utilize information from biological data.
The main outcome of this workshop is to present latest results in this
exciting area at the intersection of biology and AI.
AI approaches can revolutionize new age of bioinformatics and computational
biology with discoveries in basic biology, evolution, metagenomics, system
biology, regulatory genomics, population genomics and diseases, structural
bioinformatics, protein docking, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data
processing, chemoinformatics, etc.
Bioinformatics provides opportunities for developing novel AI methods. Some
of the grand challenges in bioinformatics include protein structure
prediction, homology search, epigenetics, multiple alignment and phylogeny
construction, genomic sequence analysis, gene finding and gene mapping, as
well as applications in gene expression data analysis, drug discovery in
pharmaceutical industry, etc.
Two questions will be at the heart of this workshop :
        -    How can AI techniques contribute to Bioinformatics research,
and in particular dealing with biological problems ?
        -    How can Bioinformatics raise new fundamental research problem
for AI research ?
This one-day workshop aims at bringing together scholars and practitioners
active in Artificial Intelligence driven Bioinformatics, to present and
discuss their research, share their knowledge and experiences, and discuss
the current state of the art and the future improvements to advance the
intelligent practice of computational biology.

Workshop topics:
We encourage papers with important new insights and experiences on
artificial intelligence from the modeling and simulation of biological
systems. Those contributions should shed light on one of the two questions
mentioned above. Topics of interest lie at the intersection of AI and
Bioinformatics. They include, but are not limited to, the following
inter-linked topics:
Artificial Intelligence:
        -     Constraints, satisfiability and search
        -     Knowledge representation, reasoning and logic
        -     Machine learning and data mining
        -     Planning and scheduling
        -     Agent-based and multi-agent systems
        -     Web and knowledge-based information systems
        -     Natural language processing
        -     Uncertainty
Bioinformatics:
        -     Systems biology and networks
        -     Comparative genomics
        -     Evolution and phylogenetics
        -     Epigenetics
        -     Funtional genomics
        -     Genome organization and annotation
        -     Genetic variation analysis
        -     Metagenomics
        -     Pathogen informatics
        -     Population genetics, variation and evolution
        -     Protein structure and function prediction and analysis
        -     Proteomics
        -     Sequence analysis


Important dates:
        -     Deadline Extension for Abstract and Paper Submission: May
29th, 2017
        -     Author Notification: Jun 30th, 2017
        -     Camera Ready Deadline: July 20th, 2017
        -     Workshop: August 21st, 2017

Submission
The workshop accepts two types of submissions:
- long papers (full research papers / ijcai format)
- short papers of 2-4 pages (for work in progress or for already published
articles --- extended abstracts)

Papers must be formatted and submitted according to the IJCAI guidelines
available on: http://ijcai-17.org/MainTrackCFP.html.
The submission deadline is May 29th for abstracts and full papers, before
11:59 PM Pacific time.
Submission should be made through Easychair at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=baiijcai2017.

Review Process
Papers will be subject to three (3) blind peer reviews. Selection criteria
include originality of ideas, correctness, clarity and significance of
results and quality of presentation.
Papers will be accepted for either oral or poster presentation. However, no
distinction will be made between accepted papers in the workshop
proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to
attend the conference, as well as the workshop to present the work. Authors
will be required to agree to this requirement at the time of final
submission.

Workshop Proceedings
Workshop proceedings will be published in the CEUR-WS workshop proceedings.
A journal special issue is planned after the workshop. Only long papers are
eligible for the special issue.
