*Software Engineering: Advanced Methods, Tools, Applications (SEMAT)*
Software is the source of most of the value added in modern 
software-intensive systems, such as process-centered information 
systems, web-based systems, mobile systems, games, or intelligent 
technical systems. The size, complexity, and criticality of 
software-intensive systems require innovative and economic approaches 
for their development and evolution. In today's competitive world, 
software quality is a key to the success and stability of organizations.

The SEMAT track presents and discusses the research of novel and 
innovative methods and technologies to software engineering, including 
both software product and development process aspects. Methods and tools 
that support the improvement of software processes and products aim at 
significantly increasing both the quality of software-intensive systems 
and the productivity of software development.

The SEMAT track will bring together researchers and practitioners to 
share SEMAT innovations and experiences.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  * Methods and tools for better software processes
  * Process modeling, composition, and enactment/simulation
  * Agile/lean development
  * User-centered development
  * Method engineering
  * Quality assurance, inspections, testing
  * Software architecture of complex software-intensive systems
  * Architecture, components, services
  * Software reuse, product lines, and software ecosystems
  * Model-based software engineering methods and tools
  * Model-based development
  * Model transformations
  * Model versioning
  * Model and meta-model co-evolution
  * Model-based testing
  * Data-driven improvement of methods, models, and tools
  * Quantitative models for development processes and products
  * Continuous delivery/integration and DevOps, software process and
    product evolution with feedback from operation
  * Legacy modernization/migration
  * Model mining techniques
  * Repository mining
  * Empirical studies and experimental approaches
  * Methods and tools for software engineering applications, including
    the areas
  * Process-centered information systems
  * Web-based systems
  * Mobile systems
  * Game development
  * Intelligent technical systems (Internet of Things)

In particular, we encourage submissions demonstrating the benefits or 
limitations of SEMAT approaches through case studies, experiments, and 
quantitative data.


*Submission*

Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting 
original unpublished research in any one of the tracks of the 
Conference. Simultaneous submission to other conferences or workshops 
with published proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions must be formatted in LNCS style and must not exceed 12 
pages, excluding references. Proofs omitted for space reasons must be 
placed in an appendix to be read by the program committee at its 
discretion. The first page must include an indication whether the paper 
is to be considered for the Student Research Forum (including the Best 
Student Paper Award, see below).

Papers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair at 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sofsem2018.


The SOFSEM proceedings, containing all accepted and invited papers, will 
appear in the Springer Lecture Notes on Computer Science series.

Student Research Forum

PhD students may submit their paper in any one of the SOFSEM tracks, as 
part of the Student Research Forum (SRF). To be eligible for the SRF, 
all authors must be students (except for their advisors). All student 
papers are reviewed by the Program Committee of the respective track as 
regular submissions. However, those not accepted for the main Springer 
LNCS proceedings but still proposing novel and contributing ideas will 
be reviewed again. Well written and promising student papers will be 
published in a separate online document.

During the conference there will be a pecial Session devoted to the SRF 
papers which includes (i) oral presentation of the papers for the 
plenary SOFSEM audience, and (ii) a poster session to enable further 
discussion between student authors and SOFSEM participants. Best Student 
Paper and Best Student Presentation Awards will be awarded during the 
conference.

Submissions to the SRF must satisfy the same format requirements and 
should be submitted according to the same time schedule as regular 
submissions.

Formatting Instructions for Submissions
Your submission has to follow the regular format of the Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science. Do not change the settings of margins and vertical 
spacing, and use numbered pages. Submissions must not exceed 12 pages 
(excluding references).

Submit your paper in PDF, no later than the deadline using EasyChair.

By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance 
at least one of the authors must register at SOFSEM 2018, attend the 
conference, and present the paper.

      <b>Submission</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting
      original unpublished research in any one of the tracks of the
      Conference. Simultaneous submission to other conferences or
      workshops with published proceedings is not allowed.<br>
      <br>
      Submissions must be formatted in LNCS style and must not exceed 12
      pages, excluding references. Proofs omitted for space reasons must
      be placed in an appendix to be read by the program committee at
      its discretion. The first page must include an indication whether
      the paper is to be considered for the Student Research Forum
      (including the Best Student Paper Award, see below).<br>
      <br>
      Papers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair at
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sofsem2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sofsem2018</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The SOFSEM proceedings, containing all accepted and invited
      papers, will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes on Computer
      Science series.<br>
      <br>
      Student Research Forum<br>
      <br>
      PhD students may submit their paper in any one of the SOFSEM
      tracks, as part of the Student Research Forum (SRF). To be
      eligible for the SRF, all authors must be students (except for
      their advisors). All student papers are reviewed by the Program
      Committee of the respective track as regular submissions. However,
      those not accepted for the main Springer LNCS proceedings but
      still proposing novel and contributing ideas will be reviewed
      again. Well written and promising student papers will be published
      in a separate online document.<br>
      <br>
      During the conference there will be a pecial Session devoted to
      the SRF papers which includes (i) oral presentation of the papers
      for the plenary SOFSEM audience, and (ii) a poster session to
      enable further discussion between student authors and SOFSEM
      participants. Best Student Paper and Best Student Presentation
      Awards will be awarded during the conference.<br>
      <br>
      Submissions to the SRF must satisfy the same format requirements
      and should be submitted according to the same time schedule as
      regular submissions.<br>
      <br>
      Formatting Instructions for Submissions<br>
      Your submission has to follow the regular format of the Lecture
      Notes in Computer Science. Do not change the settings of margins
      and vertical spacing, and use numbered pages. Submissions must not
      exceed 12 pages (excluding references).<br>
      <br>
      Submit your paper in PDF, no later than the deadline using
      EasyChair.<br>
      <br>
      By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of
      acceptance at least one of the authors must register at SOFSEM
      2018, attend the conference, and present the paper.</p>
