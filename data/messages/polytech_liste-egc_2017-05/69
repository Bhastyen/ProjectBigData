Call for papers on Data Mining and Machine Learning for e-sports analytics (in
the context of the ECML/PKDD workshop on DM and ML for sports analytics)
<br>
The use of Machine Learning and Data Mining for sports analytics has received
much attention in recent years, as the continued success of the ECML/PKDD
workshop on with the same name (MLSA) can attest to, which will see its fourth
iteration this year. Sports analytics is often focussed on "traditional"
sports, such as football, basketball, or skiing. There also exists a range of
e-sports, however, and several of the problem settings that occur in offline
sports, such as:
<br>
- strategy development, and identification<br>
- training regiments<br>
- team building<br>
- match outcome prediction<br>
- tournament design and scheduling<br>
- betting odds calculation<br>
- broadcast support (visual or by indicating historically successful actions
for given situations)<br>
<br>
obviously exist in e-sports as well. Professional teams have been formed for
games such as Starcraft 2, Defense of the Ancients (DOTA) 2, and League of
Legends. Moreover, tournaments offer large sums of prize money and are
important broadcast events.<br>
E-sports has also the advantage that data does not have to be measured or
recorded in the physical world, and then transcribed into digital formats to
be usable, but precise and detailed information is immediately available for
algorithmic processing. Additionally, developed strategies can be employed by
non-human agents to assist in training in a way that is impossible to
duplicate in offline situations.<br>
<br>
We therefore explicitly solicit papers on ML and DM for e-sports analytics for
this year's iteration of MLSA.<br>
<br>
Two types of papers can be submitted. *Long papers* will be *9* pages in
Springer LNCS style (+ references) and should report on novel, unpublished
work that might not be quite mature enough for a conference or journal
submission. *Extended abstracts* will be *2* pages in Springer LNCS style and
summarize recent publications fitting the workshop.<br>
<br>
Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee
on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity.
Submitting a paper to the workshop means that if the paper is accepted at
least one author should present the paper at the workshop.<br>
<br>
The workshop will include invited talks, a mix of oral and poster
presentations for all accepted papers, and a discussion regarding the goals,
limits, and desirability of (E-)Sports Analytics.<br>
<br>
