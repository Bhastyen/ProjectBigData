Dear all,

We are pleased to inform you that Dr. Radboud Winkels (Leibniz Center for
Law, University of Amsterdam) is coming to present in our Governance
Analytics Seminar on *30 May from 12:15 pm to 13:30 pm *at the *University
of Paris-Dauphine, room P303*.

*Title* : *Computational Legal Network Analysis*

*Introduction of Prof. Winkels: *

Radboud G.F. Winkels is associate professor in Computer Science and Law at
the =E2=80=9CLeibniz Center for Law <http://www.leibnizcenter.org/>=E2=80=
=9D (LCL) of
the Faculty
of Law <http://www.jur.uva.nl/> of the University of Amsterdam
<http://www.uva.nl/>, the Netherlands and dean of the PPLE college
<http://pple.uva.nl/>.

He started his academic career as a student in psychology at the University
of Amsterdam. In April 1987 he received his Master's Degree (with honours)
in Artificial Intelligence. Since then he has been working as a full-time
AI-researcher at the University of Amsterdam, first at the department
of "*Social
Science Informatics*" (now  Human-Computer Studies Lab
<http://hcs.science.uva.nl/>) and since March 1989 at the department of Law
and Computer Science (now LCL <http://www.lri.jur.uva.nl>), where he is now
senior lecturer/associate professor. In this last capacity he is also a
participant in the research school SIKS <http://www.siks.nl/>. His research
deals with Intelligent Learning Environments, and Artificial Intelligence
and Law.

*Legal network analysis*
Sources of Law form a large and growing network. Legislation is full of
internal and external references, case law cites other case law and refers
to legislation, legal doctrine and commentaries cite both case law and
legislation and possibly other commentaries. This reserarch is aimed at
trying to exploit this network structure to help (legal) practitioners and
legal scholars. We address questions like: Can we use network features to
determine authority of cases? Can we use it to assess the impact of planned
legislative changes? Can we exploit the network structure to suggests
useful sources of law to a practioner given a particular item, in focus?
Can legal scholars use netweork analysis techniques to discover breaches in
lines of thinking of courts?

Professor Winkels will give us a lecture on computational legal network
analysis and disucss some applications in social sciences. Anyone
interested in inter-disciplianary research on social sciences, legal
studies and computer science should not miss it.

If you=E2=80=99d like us to provide a sandwich for you, *please confirm you=
