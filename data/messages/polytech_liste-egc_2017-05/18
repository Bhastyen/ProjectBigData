*14th ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and
Applications (AICCSA 2017)*


*October 30th to November 3rd, 2017*


*Hammamet, Tunisia*

*Track 11: Digital Living including E-Learning, E-Governement, E-Health*

As networked devices become increasingly ubiquitous, the potential benefits
to users, businesses, public administrations and authorities increase
exponentially. Entities and process are embracing information technologies
in order to communicate in modern ways. In this context new concepts are
paving their way to completely change our lifestyle. Among others, we
observe the rise of the egovernment, e-Learning and ehealth.

*eGovernment* leverages information and communication technology to
strengthen and improve the quality and efficiency of public administration.
Communication is made easier for citizens and businesses, costs are lowered
and at the same time internal processes are sped up substantially. The
quality and transparency of public services is raised considerably to
everyone's benefit.

*e-Learning* is learning utilizing electronic technologies to access
educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom. In most cases,
it refers to a course, program or degree delivered completely online.
e-Learning allows people to learn anywhere and usually at any time. And
hence widening the way one can learn and share new knowledge.

*e-Health* is the transfer of health resources and health care by
electronic means. It consists of the delivery of health information, for
health professionals and health consumers, through the Internet and
telecommunications.

*The  Track 11*: *Digital Living including E-Learning, E-Governement,
E-Health* <http://www.aiccsa.net/AICCSA2017/13-tracks/38-track-11> encourages

*Submissions Guidelines and PROCEEDINGS*
Manuscripts should be prepared in 10-point font using the IEEE 8.5" x 11"
two-column format. All papers should be in PDF format, and submitted
electronically at Paper Submission Link. A full paper must not exceed the
stated length (including all figures, tables and references). Submitted
papers must present original unpublished research that is not currently
under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following
these guidelines may be rejected without review. Also submissions received
after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured
may also not be considered. Authors may contact the Program Chair for
further information or clarification.

All submissions are peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted
papers will appear in the Conference Proceedings, and be published by the
IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services and be submitted to
IEEE Xplore for inclusion.

Submitted papers must include original work, and must not be under
consideration for another conference or journal. Submission of regular
papers must not exceed 8 pages and must follow the IEEE paper format.
Please include up to 7 keywords, complete postal and e-mail address, and
fax and phone numbers of the corresponding author. Authors of accepted
papers are expected to present their work at the conference. Submitted
papers that are deemed of good quality but that could not be accepted as
regular papers will be accepted as short papers.
