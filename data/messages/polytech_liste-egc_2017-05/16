> *** Fifth Call for Doctoral Consortium ***

> 21st European Conference on Advances in Databases
> and Information Systems

> ADBIS 2017

> Hilton Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus

> 24 - 27 September, 2017

> http://cyprusconferences.org/adbis2017/consortium.html

> The internationally recognized ADBIS conference already for 21 years
> is
> gathering researchers and practitioners around topics related to
> databases,
> data processing, and information systems, in general. The conference
> is run
> in Europe but attracts researchers from all over the world. The 21st
> ADBIS
> conference will be held in Nicosia, Cyprus. The conference is
> accompanied
> by satellite events, including doctoral consortia and workshops.

> DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM

> The Doctoral Consortium (DC) is a forum where PhD students can
> present
> their research ideas, confront them with the scientific community,
> receive
> feedback from mentors, and tie cooperation bounds. Students will
> receive
> inspiration from their peers and will have a chance to discuss their
> research
> objectives with senior members of the community in the context of an
> established international conference.

> The DC session will take place on September 24, in parallel with the
> workshop sessions. Each participant will present her/his work,
> followed by
> a discussion with senior researchers.

> ELIGIBILITY

> We seek PhD students who have either determined the direction of
> their
> thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already
> published),
> but who still have substantial work to complete, or PhD student
> participants
> who are in the early stages of their dissertation year. It is not
> required to
> have a paper accepted for the main conference in order to participate
> in
> the DC.

> SUBMISSIONS

> To apply to the DC, please submit a single-authored paper (which will
> appear in the proceedings of DC), accompanied by a short email from

> the current status of the thesis research, and giving your expected
> date of
> graduation.

> The papers for DC should be at most 12 pages in Springer format
> (formatting
> instructions can be obtained via
> http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-2-793332-0) and
> describe the state of the whole PhD project, rather than a specific
> completed
> result. The paper should outline the objectives, the problem, state
> of the art,
> results obtained so far, and what is still to be done in the frame of
> the PhD
> project. If an author prefers to present a completed research result,
> the
> paper should be submitted to the main conference or one of
> accompanying
> workshops. A paper submitted to the DC may not be under review for
> any
> other conference or journal during the time it is being considered
> for the DC.

> Submissions should be made electronically in PDF format at CMT:
> https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBISDC2017. In case of multiple
> files, please submit a single compressed file (zip or rar). After

> REVIEW PROCESS

> Each paper submitted to the DC will be reviewed by at least two
> members
> of the DC program committee and will be judged based on originality,
> technical merit, presentation quality, and relevance. The authors of
