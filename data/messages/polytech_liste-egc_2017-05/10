POSTDOC OFFER

Title: Internet of Things platform architecture based on Fog computing

Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.2 [Database Management]: Systems

General Terms:


Keywords:
IoT, Fog Computing, Smart Cities, Ontology, Complex Event Processing,
Stream Processing

GOALS

The postdoc will join the team "Connected Intelligence" of Hubert Curien
laboratory / Universit=C3=A9 Jean Monnet / Telecom Saint-Etienne. The new t=
heme
"Connected Intelligence" in the laboratory consists of specialists in
knowledge representation and reasoning in multi-agent systems and services
in social networks, virtual communities and recommendation. This theme
brings together researchers with expertise related themes including:
processing and data management, cloud architectures, knowledge
representation and reasoning in large scale environments, linking the
Internet of Things and Cloud Computing.

IoT applications complexity and the huge volume of data to be processed
requires adaptation strategies of software architecture at different
levels. The state of the art cloud computing paradigms pose high latency
and privacy issues. Centralized clouds also demand good connectivity. While
most modern cities are covered with mobile networks, these networks usually
are costly and have bandwidth limits to barely serve their subscribers. Due
to these problems, the cloud is migrating to the edge of the network.
Recently, new paradigms such as fog computing and edge-computing, have been
proposed that move the computing towards the edge.

The postdoc will explore the IoT platform architecture based on Fog
computing for smart cities. Related to the platform, he/she will also work
on creating ontologies for water distribution network in smart cities and
will work on stream processing and Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems.
They will be integrated in the IoT platform.

This work will thus include:
- Exploring Fog computing IoT platform Architecture
- Defining Ontologies
- Advancing state of the art in Complex Event Processing

CONTRACT:

CDD of 6 months and the starting date is July 1, 2017. Remuneration will be
based on experience.


REQUIRED PROFILE:

PhD in Computer Science with 0-3 years experience
knowledge of topics: Data base, Ontologies, Cloud, Stream processing,
complex event processing
Java, C / C ++
Ability to work in team, in an industrial and international environment

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR APPLICATION:

CV, cover letter and a list of publications two letters of references with
contact persons
