Subject: [liste-egc] *REMINDER* Call for  Nominations - 2017 Minerva
 Informatics Equality Award

 
 
*********************************************************************

Minerva Informatics Equality Award


2017 Edition


"Supporting the transition of female PhD and postdoctoral researchers i=
nto faculty positions"


Presented by Informatics Europe
 
Sponsored by Google


Call for Nominations STILL Open

 
***********************************************************************=

 
Informatics Europe is still accepting nominations for the second Minerv=
a Informatics Equality Award devoted to initiatives which seek to encou=
rage and support the careers of women in Informatics research and educa=
tion. The second of this annual award will be presented in October 2017=
 and is sponsored by Google.

The Informatics Europe Minerva Informatics Equality Award recognizes be=
st practices in Departments or Faculties of European universities or re=
search labs that have been demonstrated to have a positive impact for w=
omen. On a three-year cycle the award will focus each year on a differe=
nt stage of the career pipeline:


=C2=B7         Developing the careers of female faculty, including rete=
ntion and promotion;

=C2=B7         Supporting the transition of female PhD and postdoctoral=
 researchers into faculty positions;

=C2=B7         Encouraging female students to enroll in Computer Scienc=
e/Informatics programmes and retaining them.

 The 2017 Award is devoted to initiatives supporting the transition of =
female PhD and postdoctoral researchers into faculty positions.

The Award seeks to celebrate successful initiatives that have had a mea=
surable impact on the careers of women within the institution. Such ini=
tiatives can serve as exemplars of best practices within the community,=
 with the potential to be widely adopted by other institutions. Nominat=
ions will need to demonstrate the impact that has been achieved.

For 2017 examples of impact could include an improved career developmen=
t and better agreements on career planning for female PhD students and =
postdocs as recorded in objective surveys of staff experience, and incr=
easing numbers of female faculty.

 
The Award carries a prize of EUR 5,000

 
The Award will be given to a Department or Faculty to be used for furth=
er work on supporting the transition of female PhD or post-docs to facu=
lty positions. To be eligible, nominated institutions must be located i=
n one of the member or candidate member countries of the

Council of Europe, or Israel. Institutions associated with members of t=
he Informatics Europe Board and of the Award panel are not eligible.

 The Award panel will review and evaluate each proposal. It reserves th=
e right to split the prize between at most two different proposals.

Moreover, noteworthy runners up may also be included as exemplars of be=
st practice in future Informatics Europe publications.

 Proposals should be submitted only at:

 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmiea2017

 
The proposal should include:


=C2=B7         Contact information for the Head of the nominated Depart=
ment or Faculty and the nominator (who can be the same);

=C2=B7         A brief summary or abstract (100 words or less) which ca=
n be made public.

=C2=B7         Description of the initiative (max 2 pages);

=C2=B7         Evidence of its impact (max 2 pages);

=C2=B7         An optional reference list (which may include URLs of su=
pporting material);
