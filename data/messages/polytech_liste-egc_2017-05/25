Dear Colleagues,

Please consider to participate or forward the following call for paper in
the special issue "Privacy Issues in the Internet of Things" of the
Security and Communication Networks Journal (Impact Factor 0.806).

For more information about the special issue, please visit:
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/si/765054/cfp/

Important Dates:
Manuscript Due: Friday, 25 August 2017
First Round of Reviews: Friday, 17 November 2017
Publication Date: Friday, 12 January 2018

Call for Papers:
Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) became an advanced technology widely
deployed in several fields including industry, transportation, energy, home
and environment monitoring, and healthcare and wellbeing applications. IoT
provides an added value service allowing users to easily supervise their
environments and helping them make suitable decisions. IoT is likely to
improve the quality of people's lives, create new markets and new
opportunities, increase economic growth, and be a momentum for competition.

Many research efforts focus on collecting and processing data coming from
different connected things. Others proposed novel processing and
communication architectures, technologies, and management strategies. IoT
systems can leverage wireless sensor networks to collect and process data
and use cloud technologies, peer-to-peer systems, and big data paradigms to
provide computation and analysis capabilities.

The other side of the coin is clearly the security and privacy issues
raised by the widespread usage of IoT. Indeed, IoT is based on the large
number of wireless sensors which involve accessibility, availability,
accuracy, and confidentiality problems. Thus, the security problems start
from the data collection phase and continue throughout the collected data
life cycle going through the transmission, storage, and processing phases.
On the other hand, the increasingly invisible, dense, and pervasive
collection, processing, and dissemination of data in the midst of people's
private lives give rise to serious privacy concerns. The tracking of
personal details of lifestyle, activities, habits, and preferences would
potentially be accessible for third or unauthorized persons to see. Through
the power of machine learning, someone can then analyze and make
predictions about future behaviors of people. The current personal data
protection approaches are based mainly on security techniques like data
encryption or access control mechanisms. However, the privacy threats in
the IoT outstrip these solutions and provoke serious challenges like
tracking and profiling leakage, accountability and responsibility, and
privacy by design paradigm.

This special issue on privacy in the Internet of Things aims to bring
together state-of-the-art contributions on IoT privacy, discover the
existing IoT privacy challenges, and introduce threat and attacker models
that can be applied to IoT architectures and design methods for ensuring
privacy of IoT applications and architectures. Original and unpublished
contributions are solicited in all aspects of this discipline.

Potential topics include but are not limited to the following:

- Privacy by design in IoT
- Tracking and profiling threats
- Middleware for preserving privacy in the Internet of Things
- Enhanced oil/gas recovery for unconventional resources
- Big data and privacy issues in the IoT
- Privacy-preserving data collection and mining in IoT
- Accountability and responsibility in IoT
- Privacy-preserving cloud of things
- New cryptographic approaches for IoT
- Anonymization techniques for IoT
- Proactive privacy models for IoT
- Data retention and disclosure issues in IoT
- Privacy policies enforcement in IoT
- Ethics and legal compliance in IoT Voluntary and controlled release of
privacy

Authors can submit their manuscripts through the Manuscript Tracking System
