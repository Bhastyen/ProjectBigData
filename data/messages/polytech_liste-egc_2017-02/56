Future Internet Services and Applications (FISA).
http://perso.isep.fr/msellami/FISA17/

A track of the 26th IEEE WETICE Conference, Poznan, Poland, June 21-23, 2017
http://wetice.ue.poznan.pl

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
Paper Submission: March 15, 2017 (Extended)
Decision Notification: April 2, 2017
Camera-Ready Submission: April 15, 2017


The proliferation of online services and applications facilitated 
considerably our lives. Nowadays we can easily communicate and share 
data with other users using these services. On-line services are also a 
building corner of ICT application such as e-commerce, e-government and 
e-health applications that facilitate many administrative and personal 
tasks. However, several emerging issues and challenges have to be 
considered while setting up these future Internet services and 
applications. In particular, we explore three different key aspects of 
future Internet services and applications:
• Modeling, Provisioning and Management
• Data Protection
• Data Collection, Storage and Analysis

The goal of this track is to offer academic and industrial researchers 
and practitioners a platform for discussions related to these aspects of 
future Internet services and applications.

TOPICS
------
We target contributions from both academia and industrials on the 
following topics, but not limited to:
• Modeling, Provisioning and Management
o Collaborative technologies for QoS Management of SOA and Cloud 
architectures
o Service Virtualization for SOA
o Collaborative Management of Virtualized Cloud Resources
o Monitoring of Cloud Services
o Reconfiguration and recovery of Cloud Services
o Modeling and Specification of collaborative Cloud services
o Service Level Agreement (SLA) Negotiation, Automation and 
Orchestration for Cloud Computing
o Cloud Federation
o Availability and Reliability of Collaborative Cloud

• Data Protection
o Privacy and Trust for the Cloud
o Accountability/Privacy techniques and models
o Accountability/Privacy of Web and cloud services
o Accountability/Privacy policy description frameworks
o Accountability/Privacy aware software design, development and composition
o Auditing of cloud services
o Accountability evidences
o Tools and frameworks for accountability

• Data Collection, Storage and Analysis
o Elastic databases and storage services
o Elastic data filtering systems
o Large scale data analysis techniques and algorithms
o Anonymity preserving data analysis techniques and algorithms
o Business intelligence
