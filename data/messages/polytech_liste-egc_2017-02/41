OVERVIEW

Cultural Heritage is gaining a lot of attention from academic and 
industry perspectives. Scientific researchers, organizations, 
associations, schools are looking for relevant technologies for 
annotating, integrating, sharing, accessing, visualizing, analyzing the 
mine of cultural data, taking also into account profiles and preferences 
of end users. Several national (CATCH in the Netherlands, FinnONTO in 
Finland, and KMM in Sweden, PATRIMA in France, etc.) and European 
programmes (EUROPEANA, PARTHENOS) have been launched to these directions.
If most of cultural information systems developed in these programmes 
begin to process data based on the syntactic, or structural level, 
without leveraging the rich semantic structures underlying the content, 
during the last decade Semantic Web solutions have also been proposed to 
explicit these semantics structures and make them machine operable and 
interoperable. In parallel, resources such as the CIDOC-CRM’s ecosystem 
have matured. As institutions bring their data to the Semantic Web 
level, the tasks of data integrating, sharing, mining, analyzing, 
visualizing, etc. are now to be conceived in this new and very rich 
framework.
Several large conferences on Semantic Web exist, and several large 
conferences on Digital Humanities including Cultural Heritage topics 
exist. As data is at the core of Cultural Heritage systems, this is 
ADBIS, a conference centered on database and information system topics, 
who host the Semantic Web for Cultural Heritage workshop. It is intended 
to be a forum for interdisciplinary research teams, involved in Semantic 
Web solutions for Cultural Heritage. Interdisciplinarity is mandatory, 
as the Semantic Web is a matter of computer, information and data 
scientists, while the Cultural Heritage field brings together actors 
from various Humanities and Social Sciences disciplines. In this novel 
collaboration space, it is crucial to have places and times to meet, 
share and discuss methods, tools, knowledge and understanding from 
different points of views.
