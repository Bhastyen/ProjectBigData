3rd Int. Workshop on Semantic Web for Scientific Heritage SW4SH 2017, in 
conjunction with ESWC 2017

http://www.cepam.cnrs.fr/zoomathia/sw4sh/

Important dates:
- March 3, 2017: Paper submission deadline
- March 31, 2017: Notification of paper acceptance
- April 13, 2017: Camera ready version
- May 29, 2017: Workshop date

The 3rd Workshop on Semantic Web for Scientific Heritage will be held in 
conjunction with the 14th ESWC 2017 Conference which takes place from 
May 28th to June 1st in Portoroz, Slovenia. It is a continuation of the 
SW4SH workshop series initiated at ESWC 2015 which aims to provide a 
leading international and interdisciplinary forum for disseminating the 
latest research in the field of Semantic Web for the preservation and 
exploitation of our scientific heritage, the study of the history of 
ideas and their transmission.

Classicists and historians are interested in developing textual 
databases, in order to gather and explore large amounts of primary 
source materials. For a long time, they mainly focused on text 
digitization and markup. They only recently decided to try to explore 
the possibility of transferring some analytical processes they 
previously thought incompatible with automation to knowledge engineering 
systems, thus taking advantage of the growing set of tools and 
techniques based on the languages and standards of the semantic Web, 
such as linked data, ontologies, and automated reasoning. The 
iconographic data, which are also relevant in history of science and 
arise similar problematic could be addressed as well and offer 
suggestive insights for a global methodology for diverse media. On the 
other hand, Semantic Web researchers are willing to take up more 
ambitious challenges than those arising in the native context of the Web 
in terms of anthropological complexity, addressing meta-semantic 
problems of flexible, pluralist or evolutionary ontologies, sources 
heterogeneity, hermeneutic and rhetoric dimensions. Thus the opportunity 
for a fruitful encounter of knowledge engineers with computer-savvy 
historians and classicists has come. This encounter may be inscribed 
within the more general context of digital humanities, a research area 
at the intersection of computing and the humanities disciplines which is 
gaining an ever-increasing momentum and where the Linked Open Data is 
playing an increasingly prominent role.

The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion about 
the methodological approaches to the specificity of annotating 
“scientific” texts (in the wide sense of the term, including disciplines 
such as history, architecture, or rhetoric), and to support a 
collaborative reflection, on possible guidelines or specific models for 
building historical ontologies. The iconographic data, which are also 
relevant in history of science and arise similar problematic could be 
addressed as well and offer suggestive insights for a global methodology 
for diverse media. A key goal of the workshop, focusing on research 
issues related to pre-modern scientific texts, is to emphasize, through 
precise projects and up-to-date investigation in digital humanities, the 
benefit of a multidisciplinary research to create and operate on 
relevantly structured data. One of the main interests of the very topic 
of pre-modern historical data management lies in historical semantics, 
and the opportunity to jointly consider how to identify and express 
lexical, theoretical and material evolutions. Dealing with historical 
texts, a major problem is indeed to handle the discrepancy of the 
historical terminology compared to the modern one, and, in the case of 
massive, diachronic data, to take into account the contextual and 
theoretical meaning of terms and segments of texts and their semantics.

Topics covered by the workshop include the following:
• Ontologies and vocabularies in Ancient Science
• Semantic annotation of ancient and medieval scientific texts
• Information/knowledge extraction from archaeological objects and texts
• Semantic integration of heterogeneous and contradicting knowledge
• Representation of the historical dimension of Scientific Knowledge
• Impact of Semantic Web technologies on Digital Humanities
• Knowledge Engineering for ancient zoological science and literature
• Social Web, collaborative systems, tagging, and user feedback

Paper Submission:
We invite short position papers (4-6 pages) and regular research papers 
(8-12 pages) describing innovative ideas covering the topics of the 
workshop.
Submissions must be written in English and follow the LNCS guidelines.
