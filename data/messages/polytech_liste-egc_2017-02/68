GENERAL INFORMATION=20
Internet of Things (IoT) is an area of innovation and growth. It is more an=
d more present in our daily lives in application areas like Smart Cars and =
mobility, Smart Cities, Health and Tourism. These applications, based on ne=
twork-enabled devices, such as smartphones, connected domotic devices, diff=
erent kinds of sensors, etc., highly contribute to data and resources gener=
ation/creation. Usually generated by such devices in an autonomous and isol=
ated way, these data and resources are often highly heterogeneous and requi=
re hard efforts to be reused, integrated or aggregated in order to obtain a=
dded-value data and services. This heterogeneity problem is intensified by =
the great volumes of such generated data and resources that makes it diffic=
ult to manage with non-automatic solutions. In this context, researches con=
ducted in the fields of Web services and semantic Web have led to interesti=
ng solutions allowing to tackle, from one hand, the heterogeneity problems =
based on standard protocols and the automation problem based on ontologies,=
 from the other hand.=20

These solutions seem however to be limited in the context of IoT for severa=
l reasons, including the different communication protocols, different const=
raints related to the connected smart devices, specificity of different use=
d ontologies, specificity of Web services composition models that makes the=
m hardly reusable, etc. A more global integration considering Linked Open D=
ata (LOD) principles should be thought for a high efficiency use and reuse =
of IoT data and resources. This could be done by well-adapting existing Sem=
antic Web standards to IoT specificities from the one hand, and by natively=
 taking into account domain knowledge while generating, linking, integratin=
g IoT data and resources, from the other hand.=20

The workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners workin=
g in IoT, Semantic Web, and Web services domains in order to present, discu=
ss and share original research works and practical experiences.=20

TOPICS=20
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:=20

- semantic Web standards, frameworks, techniques and models for IoT=20
- semantic web technologies for IoT applications development=20
- domain ontologies for IoT use cases=20
- knowledge representation and reasoning for IoT=20
- semantic-aware IoT applications success stories=20
- LOD principles for IoT data and resources linking=20
- design and development of IoT platforms=20
- smart-devices=E2=80=99 data processing and integration using Web services=
 technologies=20
- semantic-Web-based and/or LOD-based similarity measures for IoT resources=
=20
- surveys and empirical studies=20
- industrial and real use-cases=20


PAPER SUBMISSION=20
The workshop is soliciting both academic and industrial research contributi=
ons, which have not been published elsewher=20

Two types of papers are accepted for submission:=20
- Regular papers: (up to 10 pages length including references) and present =
mature work.=20
- Short and position papers: (up to 6 pages including references) and prese=
nt work in progress having an original idea behind.=20
Authors wishing to present a poster and/or demo may submit a 1 to 2 pages e=
xtended abstract, which, if accepted, will appear in the conference proceed=
ings.=20

Submitted papers must be written in English and formatted according to ACM =
format detailed at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template=20
Papers must be in PDF format and should be submitted electronically via the=
 EasyChair submission system following the url https://easychair.org/confer=
ences/?conf=3Dswitsdl2017=20
When a paper is accepted at least one of the authors has to register to the=
 conference and deliver the related talk.=20

The workshop proceedings will be published by ACM and available online from=
 the ACM Digital Library.=20
