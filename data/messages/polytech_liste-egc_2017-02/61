>> Objectives
>> Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory
>> aimed at applications in data analysis and knowledge discovery. FCA
>> allows one to build a concept lattice and dependencies of different
>> kinds (rules, implications, etc.) for input data in both supervised
>> and unsupervised forms. This machinery can be be used for many
>> purposes, e.g. learning from data, biclustering, knowledge
>> representation, reasoning, ontology engineering, information
>> retrieval, recommendation, and text processing.
>>=20
>> On the one hand FCA provides operationalisation of objects similarity
>> in terms of their common attributes (or common descriptions), on the
>> other hand Rough Set Theory studies their discernibility and provides
>> convenient means for approximation, which are complementary, in a
>> certain sense, to fuzzy concepts. Accordingly, there are many links
>> between FCA and Rough Set Theory that can be found in data analysis,
>> pattern mining, fuzzy sets theory, database theory, algebraic
>> representation, logic systems, reasoning systems, etc.
>>=20
>> Recent years have shown an increased activity in FCA, in particular =
in
>> extending FCA to different formalisms: pattern
>> structures, database representation, fuzzy FCA, relational FCA,
>> polyadic concepts, etc. These extensions allow FCA to deal with more
>> complex than just binary object-attribute data (e.g. RDF data, rating
>> matrices, sequences and graphs), for data analysis, knowledge
>> discovery and knowledge engineering.
>> Therefore, this special session will be interested in issues such as:
>>=20
>> - Relationship between FCA and Rough Set Theory, fuzzy closure
>> systems, fuzzy orders.
>> - RS/FCA algorithms for Big Data
>> - RS/FCA algorithms for complex data
>> - How can existing FCA algorithms help RS and vice versa? - RS/FCA =
for
>> Knowledge Discovery and Pattern Mining
>> - RS/FCA for Knowledge Engineering and Representation
>> - Bireducts and biclusters
>> - Rule-based approaches in RS/FCA
>> - Multi-way extensions of RS/FCA
>>=20
>> Topics of interest.
>>=20
>> The main topics include, but not limited to:
>>=20
>> - Foundations of FCA and RS
>> - Scalable algorithms in FCA and RS for Big Data.
>> - Applications of FCA and RS in complex data: text mining,
>> classification and mining in web of data, information retrieval,
>> recommendation, visualization and navigation.
