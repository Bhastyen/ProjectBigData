 14th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis


================================================================================

  ICFCA 2017

  14th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis

  June 12—16, 2017, Rennes, France

  Web: <http://icfca2017.irisa.fr/>
  Mail: icfca2017@inria.fr

================================================================================

* Call for Posters and Software Demonstrations

The International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis welcomes 
submissions of
posters on relevant topics around FCA research.  Posters should be of 
size not
larger than A0, and will be presented at the conference venue in a dedicated
poster session.  We also invite submission of proposals for 
demonstrations of
software implementing or making use of algorithms and approach from formal
concept analysis.

Proposals for posters and software demonstrations should be described in an
extended abstract of at most 4 pages.  Accepted proposals will also be 
included
in the supplementary proceedings of ICFCA, published by the University of
Rennes.  The supplementary proceedings of ICFCA will receive an ISBN.

Submission deadline is *March 24th, 2017*.  Abstracts should be send to
icfca2017@inria.fr.

* About the Conference

Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980's from attempts to restructure
lattice theory in order to promote better communication between lattice
theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since its early years, 
Formal
Concept Analysis has developed into a research field in its own right with a
thriving theoretical community and a rapidly expanding range of 
applications in
information and knowledge processing including visualization, data analysis
(mining) and knowledge management and discovery.

The ICFCA conference series aims at bringing together researchers and
practitioners working on theoretical or applied aspects of Formal Concept
Analysis within major related areas such as Mathematics and Computer and
Information Sciences and their diverse applications to fields like Software
Engineering, Linguistics, Life and Social Sciences, etc.

** Topics

Main topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*** Fundamental aspects of FCA

- FCA theory
- Lattice theory
- Lattice drawing
- Philosophical foundations
- Algorithms and complexity theory

*** Bridging FCA to information sciences and artificial intelligence

- FCA and logic, e.g., semantic web, description logics
- FCA and conceptual structures, e.g., concept graphs, knowledge spaces
- FCA and data analysis, e.g., hierarchical classification, data 
organization
- FCA and data mining, e.g., pattern mining
- FCA and information retrieval, e.g. exploratory search, navigation, 
querying
- FCA and machine learning, e.g., learning with hypothesis, feature 
selection
- FCA and database theory, e.g., dependencies, rules, data cubes
- FCA and software engineering
- FCA and morphological mathematics

*** Understanding, modelling real-world data and phenomena with FCA

- Analysis of "big data" with FCA, e.g., sampling, parallel computing
- Analysis of social networks and their dynamics
- Applications for scientific data analysis, e.g., in biology or health care
- Applications for sensors data and user interactions traces
- Other FCA applications

** Organization

The conference will be hosted by IRISA[3] and Centre de Recherche Inria 
Bretagne
Atlantique[4].
