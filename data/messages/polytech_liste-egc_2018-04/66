ARTEXT4LOD - n-ARy relaTions EXTraction for Linked Open Data

Position type: PhD Student

Starting date: October, 1st 2018

Research theme: Information extraction, N-ary relation, Ontology, Data =
mining, Active learning

Scientific advisors: Patrice Buche, INRA Montpellier, Juliette Dibie, =
AgroParisTech Paris and Mathieu Roche, CIRAD Montpellier
Partners=E2=80=99 involved:=20

=E2=80=A2 TETIS team, CIRAD TETIS JRU

Application deadline: June, 15th 2018

Job offer description
A 3-years PhD Student position is available in the ARTEXT4LOD project, a =
MUSE project (Univ. Montpellier) involving INRA IATE JRU, AgroParisTech =
& INRA MIA JRU and CIRAD TETIS JRU.
The goal of this PhD Thesis is to enrich a knowledge base with n-ary =
relations extracted from textual scientific documents. The aim of the =
ARTEXT4LOD PhD project is to ease the extraction of experimental data =
from scientific documents available on-line, experimental data being =
represented as n-ary relations where a studied object is modeled as a =
symbolic argument and its features as quantitative arguments associated =
with their attributes, i.e. the numerical value and measurement unit.=20
The PhD fellow will have to explore two main research directions:
=E2=80=A2 To exploit meta-data extracted from textual scientific =
documents to guide the n-ary relations identification and extraction =
such as figures=E2=80=99 captions, tables=E2=80=99 captions or =
structural information (e.g. abstract, summary). This first task is very =
difficult as the textual features are non-necessarily normalized (e.g. =
the units of measurement). It will consist in extending and improving =
the first results of the PhD work of Soumia Lilia Berrahou (Berrahou et =
al. 2017).
=E2=80=A2 To take into account expert knowledge, that could be learnt =
all along the n-ary relations identification and extraction. This allows =
the iterative and incremental localization, identification, extraction =
and annotation of n-ary relations using expert knowledge. This could be =
done using original methods based on active learning approaches (Silva =
et Silva 2007 ; Martinez Alonso et al. 2015) and Relevant Feedback =
(Harashima et Kurohash, 2011 ; Valcarce et al. 2018) used for =
Information Retrieval tasks.

Skills and profile
The successful candidate should hold a recent master degree in Computer =
Science or equivalent degree, with strong background knowledge in =
Ontology and Data mining; Programming skills are absolutely necessary, =
and software engineering experience is welcome.

Benefits
Monthly Gross Salary: 1 800 =E2=82=AC / Duration: 36 months
