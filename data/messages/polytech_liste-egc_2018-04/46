and explainable recommender systems mixing content analysis and =
collaborative filterings=E2=80=99'

Key Words: Recommender Systems, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, =
Transparency, sensitivity analysis, Natural Language Processing

General context Over the last twenty years, an increasing attention has =
been paid to recommender systems, widely popularized by the Netflix =
Challenge. The main goal of a recommender system is to provide some =
users, with personalized products, taking into account their profile and =
preferences.=20

Recent challenges are about the recommendation of products very complex =
to describe : jobs, partners... Their characteristics can mix =
heterogeneous features: quantitative (as ratings) and/or qualitative (as =
reviews).=20

Moreover, new questions are emerging about explainability of algorithms. =
Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence algorithms are democratized in our =
erveyday life, and consumers want to understand the decision resulting =
from these algorithms (why this decision and not another one?) as well =
as quantify the importance of each factor (element) in the decision =
process (which element is the most important/sensitive). They require =
more {\it explainability} of AI algorithms.

In addition, the new European legislation on data protection foresees to =
impose more {\it transparency} to Artificial Intelligence algorithm. The =
law envisages to make compulsory the agreement of users for using =
personal data, which will reduce the amount of data that can be =
collected about users. The customer will also have to be informed about =
the way their personal data is used. =46rom the algorithms point of =
view, the decrease of data will impact the quality of the =
recommmendations.

All these changes will impact shortly and significantly the design of =
algorithms.=20
In this thesis, we aim at designing and implementing new explainable and =
transparent recommender systems for complex products, in the frame of =
data sparsity.=20

Scientific challenges and program
The challenges are four fold :
Definition, in a quantitative way, of the concept of transparency, and =
develop statistical methods to automatically quantify  the transparency =
degree of an algorithm
Classification of recommender systems from the literature, from the =
transparency point of view and/or robustness degree with respect to =
missing data
Conception of new hybrid and explainable recommender systems, robust to =
sparse data. The products being complex, the heterogeneous descriptions =
of the products, as well as the multi-sources of information, will be =
used to construct understandable explanation. Especially,  natural =
language processing, and hybrid (content/social) approaches will be =
studied. The algorithms will also be able to quantify the weights and =
the sensitivity of each factor in the final decision.
Constitution of data sets, allowing to evaluate transparency of =
recommender systems

Application=20
The application should include a brief description of research interests =
and past experience, a CV, degrees and grades, a copy of Master thesis =
(or a draft thereof), motivation letter (short but pertinent to this =
call), relevant publications (if any), and other relevant documents.=20

Candidates are encouraged to provide letter(s) of recommendation or =
contact information to reference persons. Please send your application =
in one single pdf to: armelle.brun@univ-lorraine.fr and =
marianne.clausel@univ-lorraine.fr
The application of the preselected candidates will be reviewed by the =
Doctoral School IAEM of University of Lorraine in June 2018 for =
completing the selection process.

Deadline:
12th May 2018

Practical informations
Duration: 3 years (full time position)
Starting date:  October, 2018

Supervisors
A. Brun, University of Lorraine/LORIA, France, =
(https://members.loria.fr/ABrun/)
M. Clausel, University of Lorraine/IECL, France, =
(https://sites.google.com/site/marianneclausel)

Working Environment: The PhD candidate will work between the Probability =
and Statistic team of the IECL lab and the KIWI Team of the LORIA lab =
which are two leading institutions, respectively in Mathematics and =
Computer Science in France. The two labs are both located at Nancy, =
France on the same campus.  The Probability and Statistic team of IECL =
is working on interdisciplinary projects involving probabilistic =
modeling and inference methods, with a focus on many applications as =
textual datas, biology, spatial datas... The KIWI team of LORIA is a =
dynamic group working on recommender system and connected scientific =
domains over 20 researchers (including PhD students) and that covers =
several aspects of the subject from theory to applications, including =
statistical learning, data-mining, and cognitive science.=20

Location:  Nancy, which is the capital of Lorraine in France, with =
excellent train connection to Luxembourg (1h30) and Paris (1h30).\\
Salary after taxes: around 1600 euros.
