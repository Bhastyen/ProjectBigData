/*CENTRE@CLEF 2018 - CLEF/NTCIR/TREC Reproducibility*/
The goal of CENTRE@CLEF 2018 is to run a joint CLEF/NTCIR/TREC task on 
challenging participants: 1) to reproduce best results of best/most 
interesting systems in previous editions of CLEF/NTCIR/TREC by using 
standard open source IR systems; 2) to contribute back to the community 
the additional components and resources developed to reproduce the 
results in order to improve existing open source systems.
     - Task 1 - Replicability: replicability of selected methods on the 
same experimental collections.
     - Task 2 - Reproducibility: reproducibility of selected methods on 
the different experimental collections. Task 3 - Re-reproducibility: 
using the components developed in T1 and T2 and made available by the 
other participants to replicate/reproduce their results.

*/LifeCLEF/*
LifeCLEF lab aims at boosting research on the identification of living 
organisms and on the production of biodiversity data. Through its 
biodiversity informatics related challenges, LifeCLEF is intended to 
push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art in several research 
directions at the frontier of multimedia information retrieval, machine 
learning and knowledge engineering. The lab is organized around three tasks:
     - Task 1 - GeoLifeCLEF: location-based species recommendation.
     - Task 2 - BirdCLEF: bird species identification from bird calls 
and songs.
     - Task 3 - ExpertLifeCLEF: experts vs. machines identification quality.

/*PAN - Lab on Digital Text Forensics*/
PAN is a series of scientific events and shared tasks on digital text 
forensics.
     - Task 1 - Author Identification: cross-domain authorship 
attribution. More specifically, cases where the topic of texts varies 
significantly will be examined. In addition, we will continue the pilot 
task of style change detection, focusing on finding switches of authors 
within documents based on an intrinsic style analysis.
     - Task 2 - Author Obfuscation: while the goal of author 
identification and author profiling is to model author style so as to 
deanomyize authors, the goal of author obfuscation technology is to 
prevent that by disguising the authors. We will study author masking vs. 
authorship verification.
     - Task 3 - Author Profiling: the goal is to identify an author's 
traits based on their writing style. The focus will be on age and 
gender, whereas text and image will be used as information sources, 
offering tweets in English, Spanish and Arabic.

/*CLEF eHealth*/
Medical content is available electronically in a variety of forms 
ranging from patient records and medical dossiers, scientific 
publications and health-related websites to medical-related topics 
shared across social networks. This lab aims to support the development 
of techniques to aid laypeople, clinicians and policy-makers in easily 
retrieving and making sense of medical content to support their decision 
making.
     - Task 1 - Multilingual Information Extraction: Participants will 
be required to extract the causes of death from death certificates, 
authored by physicians in European languages. This can be seen as a 
named entity recognition, normalization, and/or text classification task.
     - Task 2 - Technologically Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine: 
Participants will be challenged to retrieve medical studies relevant to 
conducting a systematic review on a given topic. This can be seen as a 
total recall problem and is addressed by both query generation and 
document ranking.
     - Task 3 - Patient-centred Information Retrieval: Participants must 
retrieve web pages that fulfil a given patient’s personalised 
information need. This needs to fulfil the following criteria: 
information reliability, quality, and suitability. The task also has a 
multilingual querying track.

/*MC2 - Multilingual Cultural Mining and Retrieval*/
Developing processing methods and resources to mine the social media 
sphere surrounding cultural events such as festivals. This requires to 
deal with almost all languages and dialects as well as informal 
expressions.There are three tasks:
     - Task 1 - Cross Language Cultural Retrieval over MicroBlogs: a) 
Small Microblogs Multilingual Information Retrieval in Arabic, English, 
French and Latin languages; b) Microblogs Bilingual Information 
Retrieval for tuning systems running on language pairs; c) Microblog 
Monolingual Information Retrieval based on 2017 language identification.
     - Task 2 - Mining Opinion Argumentation: a) Polarity detection in 
microblogs; b) Automatic identification of argumentation elements over 
Microblogs and WikiPedia; c) Classification and summarization of 
arguments in texts.
     - Task 3 - Dialectal Focus Retrieval: a) Arabic dialects in Blogs, 
MicroBlogs and Video News transcriptions; b) Spanish language variations 
in Blogs, MicroBlogs and Journals. Lab /Coordination:/ Chiraz Latiri

*/ImageCLEF - Multimedia Retrieval in CLEF/*
The lab provides an evaluation forum for the language independent 
annotation and retrieval of images, a domain for which tools are by far 
not as advanced as for text analysis and retrieval.
     - Task 1 - ImageCLEFlifelog: An increasingly wide range of personal 
devices, such as smartphones, video cameras as well as wearable devices 
that allow capturing pictures, videos, and audio clips in every moment 
of our life are becoming available. The task addresses the problems of 
lifelogging data understanding, summarization and retrieval.
     - Task 2 - ImageCLEFcaption: Interpreting and summarizing the 
insights gained from medical images such as radiology output is a 
time-consuming task that involves highly trained experts and often 
represents a bottleneck in clinical diagnosis pipelines. The task 
addresses the problem of bio-medical image concept detection and caption 
prediction from large amounts of training data.
     - Task 3 - ImageCLEFtuberculosis: The objective of this task is to 
determine tuberculosis subtypes and drug resistances, as far as possible 
automatically, from the volumetric image information in computed 
tomography (CT) volumes (mainly texture analysis) and based on clinical 
information (e.g., age, gender, etc).
     - Task 4 - VisualQuestionAnswering: With the ongoing drive for 
improved patient engagement and access to the electronic medical records 
via patient portals, patients can now review structured and unstructured 
data from labs and images to text reports associated with their 
healthcare utilization. Given a medical image accompanied with a set of 
clinically relevant questions, participating systems are tasked with 
answering the questions based on the visual image content.

/*PIR-CLEF - Evaluation of Personalised Information Retrieval*/
The primary aim of the PIR-CLEF 2018 laboratory is: 1) to facilitate 
comparative evaluation of PIR by offering participating research groups 
a mechanism for evaluation of their personalisation algorithms; 2) to 
give the participating groups the means to formally define and evaluate 
their own and novel user profiling approaches for PIR.
     - Task 1 - Personalized Search: we will provide a bag-of-words 
profile gathered during the query sessions performed by real searchers, 
the set of queries formulated by each user, together with the 
corresponding document relevance, and the the search logs of each user. 
Task participants will be expected to compute search results obtained by 
applying their personalization algorithms on these queries. The search 
will be carried out on the ClueWeb12 collection, by using the API 
provided by DCU.
     - Task 2 - User Profile Models: participants will be required to 
develop their own user profile models using the information gathered 
about the real user during her interactions with the system. The same 
information have been used for creating the baseline (keyword-based user 
profiles), which is provided in the benchmark.

/*eRISK - Early Risk Prediction on the Internet*/
eRisk explores the evaluation methodology, effectiveness metrics and 
practical applications (particularly those related to health and safety) 
of early risk detection on the Internet.
     - Task 1 - Early Detection of Signs of Depression: the challenge 
consists of sequentially processing pieces of evidence (Social Media 
entries) and detect early traces of depression as soon as possible.
     - Task 2 - Early Detection of Signs of Anorexia: the challenge 
consists of sequentially processing pieces of evidence (Social Media 
entries) and detect early traces of anorexia as soon as possible.
Both tasks are mainly concerned about evaluating Text Mining solutions 
and, thus, we concentrate on texts written in Social Media. Texts should 
be processed in the order they were posted. In this way, systems that 
effectively perform this task could be applied to sequentially monitor 
user interactions in blogs, social networks, or other types of online media.

/*DynSe - Dynamic Search for Complex Tasks*/
The primary aim of the CLEF Dynamic Search Lab is to develop algorithms 
which interact dynamically with user (or other algorithms) towards 
solving a task, and evaluation methodologies to quantify their 
effectiveness. The lab is organized along two tasks:
     - Task 1 - Query Suggestion: given a verbose topic description 
participants will generate and submit a sequence of queries and a 
ranking of the collection for each query. Queries will be evaluated over 
their effectiveness (query agent) and/or resemblance to user queries 
(user simulation). Query suggestion will be performed iteratively.
     - Task 2 - Result Composition: Given the obtained results from the 
aforementioned queries obtain a single ranked list by merging the 
individual rankings.

/*CheckThat! - Automatic Identification and Verification of Political 
Claims*/
CheckThat! aims to foster the development of technology capable of both 
spotting and verifying check-worthy claims in political debates in 
English and Arabic.
     - Task 1 - Check-Worthiness: Given a political debate, which is 
segmented into sentences with speakers annotated, identify which 
statements (claims) should be prioritized for fact-checking. This will 
be a ranking problem, and systems will be asked to produce a score, 
according to which the ranking will be performed.
     - Task 2 - Factuality: Given a list of already-extracted claims, 
classify them with factuality labels (e.g., true, half-true, false). 
This task will be run in an open mode. We will not provide any 
pre-selected set of documents to support the veracity labels. 
Participants will be free to use whatever resources they have and the 
Web in general, with the exception of the websites used by the 
organizers to collect the data.

      <b><i>LifeCLEF</i></b><br>
      LifeCLEF lab aims at boosting research on the identification of
      living organisms and on the production of biodiversity data.
      Through its biodiversity informatics related challenges, LifeCLEF
      is intended to push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art in
      several research directions at the frontier of multimedia
      information retrieval, machine learning and knowledge engineering.
      The lab is organized around three tasks:<br>
          - Task 1 - GeoLifeCLEF: location-based species recommendation.<br>
          - Task 2 - BirdCLEF: bird species identification from bird
      calls and songs.<br>
          - Task 3 - ExpertLifeCLEF: experts vs. machines identification
      quality.<br>

      <i><b>PAN - Lab on Digital Text Forensics</b></i><br>
      PAN is a series of scientific events and shared tasks on digital
      text forensics.<br>
          - Task 1 - Author Identification: cross-domain authorship
      attribution. More specifically, cases where the topic of texts
      varies significantly will be examined. In addition, we will
      continue the pilot task of style change detection, focusing on
      finding switches of authors within documents based on an intrinsic
      style analysis.<br>
          - Task 2 - Author Obfuscation: while the goal of author
      identification and author profiling is to model author style so as
      to deanomyize authors, the goal of author obfuscation technology
      is to prevent that by disguising the authors. We will study author
      masking vs. authorship verification.<br>
          - Task 3 - Author Profiling: the goal is to identify an
      author's traits based on their writing style. The focus will be on
      age and gender, whereas text and image will be used as information
      sources, offering tweets in English, Spanish and Arabic.<br>

      <i><b>CLEF eHealth</b></i><br>
      Medical content is available electronically in a variety of forms
      ranging from patient records and medical dossiers, scientific
      publications and health-related websites to medical-related topics
      shared across social networks. This lab aims to support the
      development of techniques to aid laypeople, clinicians and
      policy-makers in easily retrieving and making sense of medical
      content to support their decision making.<br>
          - Task 1 - Multilingual Information Extraction: Participants
      will be required to extract the causes of death from death
      certificates, authored by physicians in European languages. This
      can be seen as a named entity recognition, normalization, and/or
      text classification task.<br>
          - Task 2 - Technologically Assisted Reviews in Empirical
      Medicine: Participants will be challenged to retrieve medical
      studies relevant to conducting a systematic review on a given
      topic. This can be seen as a total recall problem and is addressed
      by both query generation and document ranking.<br>
          - Task 3 - Patient-centred Information Retrieval: Participants
      must retrieve web pages that fulfil a given patient’s personalised
      information need. This needs to fulfil the following criteria:
      information reliability, quality, and suitability. The task also
      has a multilingual querying track.<br>

      <i><b>MC2 - Multilingual Cultural Mining and Retrieval</b></i><br>
      Developing processing methods and resources to mine the social
      media sphere surrounding cultural events such as festivals. This
      requires to deal with almost all languages and dialects as well as
      informal expressions.There are three tasks:<br>
          - Task 1 - Cross Language Cultural Retrieval over MicroBlogs:
      a) Small Microblogs Multilingual Information Retrieval in Arabic,
      English, French and Latin languages; b) Microblogs Bilingual
      Information Retrieval for tuning systems running on language
      pairs; c) Microblog Monolingual Information Retrieval based on
      2017 language identification.<br>
          - Task 2 - Mining Opinion Argumentation: a) Polarity detection
      in microblogs; b) Automatic identification of argumentation
      elements over Microblogs and WikiPedia; c) Classification and
      summarization of arguments in texts.<br>
          - Task 3 - Dialectal Focus Retrieval: a) Arabic dialects in
      Blogs, MicroBlogs and Video News transcriptions; b) Spanish
      language variations in Blogs, MicroBlogs and Journals. Lab <i>Coordination:</i>

      <b><i>ImageCLEF - Multimedia Retrieval in CLEF</i></b><br>
      The lab provides an evaluation forum for the language independent
      annotation and retrieval of images, a domain for which tools are
      by far not as advanced as for text analysis and retrieval.<br>
          - Task 1 - ImageCLEFlifelog: An increasingly wide range of
      personal devices, such as smartphones, video cameras as well as
      wearable devices that allow capturing pictures, videos, and audio
      clips in every moment of our life are becoming available. The task
      addresses the problems of lifelogging data understanding,
      summarization and retrieval.<br>
          - Task 2 - ImageCLEFcaption: Interpreting and summarizing the
      insights gained from medical images such as radiology output is a
      time-consuming task that involves highly trained experts and often
      represents a bottleneck in clinical diagnosis pipelines. The task
      addresses the problem of bio-medical image concept detection and
      caption prediction from large amounts of training data.<br>
          - Task 3 - ImageCLEFtuberculosis: The objective of this task
      is to determine tuberculosis subtypes and drug resistances, as far
      as possible automatically, from the volumetric image information
      in computed tomography (CT) volumes (mainly texture analysis) and
      based on clinical information (e.g., age, gender, etc).<br>
          - Task 4 - VisualQuestionAnswering: With the ongoing drive for
      improved patient engagement and access to the electronic medical
      records via patient portals, patients can now review structured
      and unstructured data from labs and images to text reports
      associated with their healthcare utilization. Given a medical
      image accompanied with a set of clinically relevant questions,
      participating systems are tasked with answering the questions
      based on the visual image content.<br>

      <i><b>PIR-CLEF - Evaluation of Personalised Information Retrieval</b></i><br>
      The primary aim of the PIR-CLEF 2018 laboratory is: 1) to
      facilitate comparative evaluation of PIR by offering participating
      research groups a mechanism for evaluation of their
      personalisation algorithms; 2) to give the participating groups
      the means to formally define and evaluate their own and novel user
      profiling approaches for PIR.<br>
          - Task 1 - Personalized Search: we will provide a bag-of-words
      profile gathered during the query sessions performed by real
      searchers, the set of queries formulated by each user, together
      with the corresponding document relevance, and the the search logs
      of each user. Task participants will be expected to compute search
      results obtained by applying their personalization algorithms on
      these queries. The search will be carried out on the ClueWeb12
      collection, by using the API provided by DCU.<br>
          - Task 2 - User Profile Models: participants will be required
      to develop their own user profile models using the information
      gathered about the real user during her interactions with the
      system. The same information have been used for creating the
      baseline (keyword-based user profiles), which is provided in the
      benchmark.<br>

      <i><b>eRISK - Early Risk Prediction on the Internet</b></i><br>
      eRisk explores the evaluation methodology, effectiveness metrics
      and practical applications (particularly those related to health
      and safety) of early risk detection on the Internet.<br>
          - Task 1 - Early Detection of Signs of Depression: the
      challenge consists of sequentially processing pieces of evidence
      (Social Media entries) and detect early traces of depression as
      soon as possible.<br>
          - Task 2 - Early Detection of Signs of Anorexia: the challenge
      consists of sequentially processing pieces of evidence (Social
      Media entries) and detect early traces of anorexia as soon as
      possible.<br>
      Both tasks are mainly concerned about evaluating Text Mining
      solutions and, thus, we concentrate on texts written in Social
      Media. Texts should be processed in the order they were posted. In
      this way, systems that effectively perform this task could be
      applied to sequentially monitor user interactions in blogs, social
      networks, or other types of online media.<br>

      The primary aim of the CLEF Dynamic Search Lab is to develop
      algorithms which interact dynamically with user (or other
      algorithms) towards solving a task, and evaluation methodologies
      to quantify their effectiveness. The lab is organized along two
      tasks:<br>
          - Task 1 - Query Suggestion: given a verbose topic description
      participants will generate and submit a sequence of queries and a
      ranking of the collection for each query. Queries will be
      evaluated over their effectiveness (query agent) and/or
      resemblance to user queries (user simulation). Query suggestion
      will be performed iteratively. <br>
          - Task 2 - Result Composition: Given the obtained results from
      the aforementioned queries obtain a single ranked list by merging
      the individual rankings.<br>

      CheckThat! aims to foster the development of technology capable of
      both spotting and verifying check-worthy claims in political
      debates in English and Arabic.<br>
          - Task 1 - Check-Worthiness: Given a political debate, which
      is segmented into sentences with speakers annotated, identify
      which statements (claims) should be prioritized for fact-checking.
      This will be a ranking problem, and systems will be asked to
      produce a score, according to which the ranking will be performed.<br>
          - Task 2 - Factuality: Given a list of already-extracted
      claims, classify them with factuality labels (e.g., true,
      half-true, false). This task will be run in an open mode. We will
      not provide any pre-selected set of documents to support the
      veracity labels. Participants will be free to use whatever
      resources they have and the Web in general, with the exception of
      the websites used by the organizers to collect the data.<br>
