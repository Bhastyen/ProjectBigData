* Discussion about funding opportunities such as H2020 and ERC

Also, it will include a presentation by a representative of the European =
Commission on the European Research Council (ERC) and ERC funding =
schemes.

The project networking track is intended to provide national and EU =
funded projects with the ability to connect with each other and engage =
in discussions about their respective research and development, =
establish opportunities for knowledge and technology sharing, and =
identify complementary activities and goals which can form the basis for =
future collaborations, research proposals, researcher exchange or joint =
participation at events or in initiatives.=20

We equally welcome submissions from recently finished projects, which =
have results to transfer as well as recently started EU and national =
projects, which are seeking datasets and tools to perform their work.=20

projects and/or wishes to request from other projects. This should be =
backed up by links to online datasets, tools or use cases where =
requirements are identified.=20

There will be a limited number of places for projects in the networking =
space. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to =
ESWC2018, tangible innovation and uniqueness in the R&D activities and a =
clear goal to benefit from networking with other projects.
