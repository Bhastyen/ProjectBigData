Introduction and Scope:
--------------------------------
Formal Methods (FM) are mathematically based techniques to model, design,
and analyze computing systems. Such techniques aim at improving the
dependability of computing systems. Different techniques may be required
throughout the development life cycle and to cover the different aspects of
the system.
Machine learning and nowadays deep neural networks match human abilities in
various tasks. Solutions based on machine learning are ubiquitous, from
automated medical diagnosis and self-driving cars to security. However,
machine learning does not offer guarantees or reasoning techniques to prove
the dependability of the automated decisions. Such systems must be
verified/validated using existing techniques or call for new techniques.
Formal reasoning techniques are needed to arrive at as well as to explain
deductive and even inductive conclusions.
This year's workshop is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Thouraya
Bouabana-Tebibel who founded the series and organized all of the previous
years. The workshop seeks contributions from researchers and practitioners
interested in all aspects of integrated methods, either formal or
semi-formal, for system development covering all engineering development
phases from user requirements through validation/testing. The workshop
encourages contributions from new initiatives building bridges between FM
and machine learning, especially contributions using FM as a tool to verify
safety-critical machine learning systems. Moreover, logics for learning and
generalization, which are distinct from neural methods are especially
welcome.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
------------------------------------------------------------------
* Modelling uncertainty in deep learning
* Verification methodologies for machine learning
* Integration of deep learning modules for deeper learning
* Methods for, results in, and applications of auto-associative neural
network
* Axiomatic and denotational semantics for provable higher-level
specifications
* Predicate calculi for concept capture and resolution
* Integrated software/hardware specification and analysis
* Hybrid and embedded systems modeling and analysis
* Object and multi-agent systems modeling and analysis
* Requirement specification and analysis
* Software and hardware specification, verification, and validation
* Theorem proving and decision procedures
* Formal aspects of software evolution and maintenance
* Formal methods for re-engineering and reuse
* Randomization-based methods for simplification/optimization
* Formal languages integration
* Semi-formal (UML, SysML, .) and formal model integration
* Informal and formal language integration
* Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice
* Integrated analysis techniques
* Tools integration
* Integrated formal methods in education
* Integrated formal methods in health
* Integrated formal methods in industry
* Integrated formal methods in security

Important dates
----------------------
* Paper submission deadline: May 02, 2018  [Extended]
* Paper notification: June 1st, 2018
* Camera ready submission deadline: June 20th, 2018

Paper submission
------------------------
Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for
publication. Submissions will undergo a rigorous review process handled by
the Technical Program Committee. Papers will be selected based on their
originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. Only
electronic submissions in PDF format through the EasyChair submission site
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfmi2018 will be considered. Pape=
rs
must be in English, up to 8 pages in IEEE format, including references and
appendices. The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as
formatting guidelines, can be found on the paper submission instructions
available at the main conference website.

Paper Publication
------------------------
At least one of the authors must register and present each accepted paper.
Registered and presented papers will be published as workshop papers in the
IEEE IRI conference proceedings published by IEEE Computer Society Press
and included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. As for previous editions
of the workshop, authors of best papers will be invited to expand and
submit their papers for possible publication in a book of Advanced in
Intelligent Systems and Computing and in a special issue of the Information
Systems Frontiers journal both published by Springer [Pending approval].
