The Eight International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) 
will be held from 24 to 26 October 2018 in Marrakesh, Morocco. Its main 
objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research 
accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between 
the models and data research communities. MEDI’2018 provides an 
international platform for the presentation of research on models and 
data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and 
data and their advanced applications. This international scientific 
event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims 
also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, 
projects and faculty/student exchanges.

*Topics

*Specific areas of interest to MEDI 2018 include but are not limited to:

*Modelling and Models Engineering*

-       Modelling languages and related standards
-       Modelling in software and complex system engineering
-       Formal methods, analysis, verification & validation
-       Model-based testing and performance analyses
-       Ontology-based modelling
-       Heterogeneous modelling, model integration, interoperability, 
model transformation
-       Collaborative modelling and model repositories
-       Models as services and models monitoring
-       Modelling for reuse, dependability and maintainability
-       Models for Big Data & NoSql databases

*Data Engineering*

-       New models and architectures for databases
-       Heterogeneous data, data Integration, Interoperability
-       Data warehouses, OLAP, data mining and Analytics
-       Extending Data Warehousing Technology
-       Database system Internals, performance analysis, self-tuning 
benchmarking and testing
-       Database security, personalization, recommendation
-       Web databases, ontology-based databases
-       Service based data management
-       Service oriented applications
-       Urbanization of database applications

*Applications and tooling*

-       Industry transfer, experiences
-       Applications of modelling for Data Management
-       Modelling tools and experimentation
-       Lessons learned and reports related to models/data engineering

*Submission Guidelines and Instructions*

Authors are invited to submit English-language research and application 
papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Duplicate 
submissions are not allowed. Papers must be submitted as a single PDF 
document, via the Easychair system 
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=medi2018). Submissions must 
conform to Springer's LNCS style (Latex style only for camera-ready 
papers) and should not exceed 14 pages. Submitted papers will be 
carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical 
soundness, and clarity of exposition. The program committee may decide 
to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting 
results, but does not justify a publication as a full paper. All 
accepted papers including short papers will be published in Springer 
LNCS series. An author of an accepted paper must register to MEDI 2018 
in order to have the paper published. Each accepted paper must be 
presented at the conference by one of the authors.

*Publication*
All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag.
