Synopsis

Text mining is widely used in many different domains in order to =
classify opinions, to analyse sentiments, to acquire and represent =
knowledge or to understand complex processes. One common feature to =
these approaches is that they should be appliable to a large amount of =
real raw texts. At present, we may distinguish two main types of =
approaches. One concerns mainly classification of texts into categories, =
typically identifying if a text correspond to a positive or a negative =
opinion. The second type concerns the extraction of knowledge from =
texts. It usually requires several steps like information extraction =
(identification of domain entities, relations between them) and then a =
conceptualisation step to organise information into knowledge units =
(data mining tools).=20

There is one very challenging dimension that has always been neglicted =
in text mining: the disourse level. And we claim that this is the next =
step to properly understand the content of documents. So what means =
=E2=80=9Cdiscourse level=E2=80=9D and what could it be used for ?

There exist several discourse theories in computational linguistics but =
for sake of simplicity, we will consider here that the discourse level =
relates some parts of a text (discourse units) with some others, of the =
same text, making explicit the kind of relation between them: one =
sentence may elaborate on the previous one, another sentence gives the =
cause of a previous event. . . In other words, discourse structures make =
texts different from a simple juxtaposition of sentences.

Discourse relations can thus be used to better understand causes, =
consequences, temporal order between events. . . Today, many companies =
crawl the web to collect reviews of products or services. While =
sentiment analysis or opinion mining currently assign a positive or a =
negative flag and provide some keywords to explain the result, discourse =
may explain what are the main arguments, what is the sequence of events =
or what are the main reasons that make the customer positive or =
negative. In a scientific domain (ex. medical domain), discourse =
structure enables a better understanding of the temporal order of =
symptoms or the onset of diseases, the effects and side effects of a =
treatment. . .

Recent research advances in linguistics, in natural language processing, =
in classification, graph mining and in (deep) learning, all contribute =
to define a new paradigm to propose new methods for mining texts at the =
discourse level. The thesis should thus explore different formalisms, =
specify the goal of discourse mining and combine methods coming from =
several domains. Indeed, discourse representations are complex =
structures that can be compared (to extract similar parts of texts) or =
classified.=20=
