3rd International Workshop on Big Data Management in Cloud Systems (BDMICS 2018)
In parallel with DEXA 2018 (www.dexa.org)

September 4, 2018, Regensburg, Germany
Workshop URL:http://www.dexa.org  orhttp://www.irit.fr/BDMICS2018

*1. Important Dates:*  

Manuscript submissions:*May 14th, 2018*  
Notification of acceptance: June 15th, 2018
Final version deadline: June 25th, 2018	

*2. Publication*

A. Proceedings
All accepted papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society's Conference Publishing Services (CPS) as proceedings of the
DEXA'17 workshops (indexed by the Thomson ISI Web of Knowledge). At least one author is required to attend the workshop and
present the paper.

B. Distinguished Papers

Extended versions of selected papers will be published in the International Journal "Transactions on Large-scale Data and
Knowledge-Centerd Systems", LNCS Springer Verlag.  Homepage:http://tldks.faw.at/home/

*3. Scope & Topics*

Big data management in large-scale distributed systems and new applications that require voluminous, distributed, heterogeneous and
  dynamic data is the subject of many research. These research leaded, principally, in Cloud  computing topics will make considerable
  impact on the viability of the next generation of large-scale data management systems for big data applications.
Today, these topics require more research in order to raise still open challenges like scalability, elasticity, consistency,
security and autonomic data management.

The main objective of the annual international workshop on Big Data Management in Cloud Systems is to present and exchange
the latest results in research and applications,  and to shape future directions.

Original papers preferably but not limited to the following topics are welcome :

     * Big Data Science and Foundation
     * Big Data Infrastructures
     * Big Data Mining and Analytics
     * Big Data and Semantic Web
     * Data Storage and Management
     * Data Integration and Metadata Management
     * Data Stream Systems
     * Query Languages
     * Dynamic Data Placement Issues
     * Flexible and Adaptive Query Processing
     * Support for Scalable and Elastic Services
     * Query Processing and Optimization
     * Big Data Warehousing
     * Cost Models in Heterogeneous Environments
     * Economic Pricing Models
     * Dynamic Resource Management, Reservation, and Scheduling
     * Multi-tenancy and Workload Isolation
     * Locating Data Sources/Resources and Scalability
     * Web Services
     * Workload Adaptability in Heterogeneous Environments
     * Transaction Management
     * Replicated Copy Control and Caching
     * Big Data Privacy and Security
     * Big Data Visualization
     * Big Data Applications for Vertical Industries
     * Mobile Cloud Computing
     * Large-scale Distributed Applications and Experiences
     * Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking
