CALL FOR PAPERS

The 3rd International workshop on Educational Knowledge Management (EKM 201=
8)

http://uni.gsu.edu.tr/EKM2018/

in conjunction with the The Web Conference 2018, formerly known as WWW2018)=
 (https://www2018.thewebconf.org/), to be held in Lyon, France, from April =
23 to 27, 2018.


Workshop description

The high volume of information in organizations has led researchers to star=
ting to understand and appreciate knowledge and search how to manage it. Kn=
owledge management aims to retrieve and share information within databases,=
 documents or know-how of organizations=92 employees in order to help them =
to cooperate and improve their ideas, increase the opportunities for innova=
tion, and therefore enable organizations to better stay ahead of the compet=
ition. Many organizations such as business, industrial, and medical ones ar=
e implementing technologies and tools to better manage their knowledge. How=
ever, these tools, and techniques can be applied in the educational domain.=
 The interest in Knowledge Management for the educational domain has been g=
rowing in recent years. This can be seen in the series of conferences organ=
ized by the International Educational Data Mining Society and in papers dis=
cussing the role of knowledge management in higher education. As education =
is increasingly occurring online or in educational software, resulting in a=
n explosion of data, new technologies such as semantic web and data mining =
techniques are being developed and tested, aiming for instance to improve e=
ducational effectiveness, determine the key factors to the success of educa=
tional training, support basic research on learning, or manage educational =
training by satisfying the needs of a community, local industry, or profess=
ional development. In this workshop, we welcome submissions reporting origi=
nal research presenting how the web technologies can resolve any problem of=
 managing and exploring information in the educational area in schools, col=
leges, universities, and other academic or professional learning institutio=
ns. Indeed, how these technologies can face the current evolution of educat=
ional systems especially the mobility of students/teachers involved in inte=
ractive learning, the improvement of student retention and graduation rates=
, analyze the importance of social media and games in learning, generate ex=
am=92s questions from text files, etc.

We welcome papers describing original work applied to education. A non-exha=
ustive list of topics for the workshop includes the following:
=95 Educational knowledge management and ontologies
=95 Educational data mining
=95 Educational Linked data and semantic web
=95 Knowledge acquisition, extraction, and reuse in education
=95 Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Human computer Interaction in Edu=
cation
=95 Natural language processing to improve educational effectiveness
=95 Providing feedback to teachers and other stakeholders generated from EK=
M methods
=95 Learner or student modeling
=95 Learning analytics
=95 Improving educational software
=95 Practice learning experiences and techniques
=95 Evaluating and improving teacher=92s support
=95 Educational knowledge evolution
=95 Social media and games in learning
=95 Global Issues in Education and Research

Workshop co-chairs

Inaya Lahoud, Galatasaray University, Istanbul, Turkey.
Elsa Cardoso, Instituto Universit=E1rio de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal
Nada Matta, University of Technology of Troyes, Troyes, France.
