Call For PhD Symposium

15th  ESWC 2018

Conference days: June 3rd-7th, 2018, Heraklion, Crete, Greece
Submission Deadline: March 13th, 2018

Web site: https://2018.eswc-conferences.org
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

The ESWC 2018 PhD Symposium is a forum for PhD students working in all =
areas of Semantic Web research to present their work, meet with peers =
and experienced researchers, obtain feedback and learn from each =
other=E2=80=99s experiences. It aims at helping future researchers in =
developing the skills and confidence required to conduct and promote =
their research, as well as providing them with an opportunity to attend =
one of the most important research conferences on the Semantic Web.

The ESWC PhD Symposium will give students the opportunity to:

1. Learn by constructive criticism:
Established researchers and PhD student advisors will provide =
constructive feedback to the submitted papers by means of an open and =
non-adversarial review process.

2. Learn from a mentor
Each selected student will be assigned a member of the programme =
committee with whom they will interact on the revision of the paper and =
the preparation of the presentation.

3. Learn about research
Doing good research goes beyond writing a good paper; it includes =
perspectives on research as an endeavour and a career. Besides the =
presentations, coffee breaks and the PhD mentoring lunch will be used to =
exchange ideas and ask questions about all aspects of pursuing a PhD and =
a research career in general.

4. Learn by presenting:
Accepted contributions will be presented at the PhD Symposium. All =
accepted contributions will also appear at the general poster session of =
ESWC. Students=E2=80=99 posters will be presented alongside posters and =
demonstrations of the main conference.

Submissions will be divided into two different categories depending on =
the advancement into the PhD:

* Early Stage PhD: Students who may have identified the main research =
problem they want to address as well as the relevant literature, and who =
are building their research methodology, but who might not yet have =
obtained significant results, or only preliminary ones.
* Late Stage PhD: Students who have already defined their approach (even =
if incompletely) and obtained significant results (e.g., that might =
already have been published).

These categories do not affect the chances of being selected. They will, =
however, be taken into account by the reviewers in their feedback, and =
in the length and format of the presentation. The organisers might =
decide to move a submission from one category to the other, if they =
think it is justified.



Submission Information

PhD students in all areas of Semantic Web research are invited to submit =
papers having 5 to 10 pages describing their PhD research, in PDF =
format, following the LNCS template (see =
https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-6-793341-0 ).=20
Submissions must be uploaded to EasyChair selecting the ESWC 2018 PhD =
Symposium Track at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Deswc2018 =
through which participants will also be asked to indicate the category =
of their submission.
We solicit submissions on topics related to the Semantic Web including =
the following:

* Vocabularies, Schemas, Ontologies
* Reasoning
* Linked Open Data
* Social Web and Web Science
* Semantic Data Management, Big Data, Scalability
* Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval using the =
Semantic Web
* Database, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and =
Artificial Intelligence technologies for the Semantic Web
* Machine Learning for the Semantic Web
* Mobile Web, Sensors and Semantic Streams
* Services, APIs, Processes, and Cloud Computing
* Cognition and Semantic Web
* Human Computation and Crowdsourcing
* Search, Query, Integration, and Analysis
* Visualization
* Multimedia for the Semantic Web

Submissions should clearly indicate the category of the submission =
(Early Stage PhD or Late Stage PhD) and should adopt the following =
template of sections:

1. Introduction/Motivation
Give a general introduction to the domain/area/topic and indication of =
its importance/impact in Semantic Web research or other domains.

2.	State of the Art
Describe existing work in the area, work focusing on the same/similar =
problems or that might be useful to realising your PhD.

3.	Problem Statement and Contributions
Based on motivation and state of the art, formulate the problem you =
intend to solve, and how you intend to contribute to Semantic Web =
research. This section should include a clear formulation of one (or =
very few) research hypothesis (what statement you want to validate =
through your methodology, approach and evaluation) and the research =
questions that need to be answered. Late Stage PhD submissions should =
focus on contributions to such a hypothesis.

4.	Research Methodology and Approach
Describe the research methodology you will apply in your research, =
including the different steps from the formulation of your research =
questions to answering them. Also describe the approach you are taking =
(or you intend to take for Early Stage PhD submissions) to instantiate =
the research methodology, hence contributing to solve the problem =
described in Section 3 and confirm or reject your hypothesis. Discuss =
how this approach is innovative and novel, and how it is (might be) =
implemented.

5.	Preliminary or Intermediate Results
In a full conference paper, the approach would be fully described (in =
Section 4) and fully evaluated (in Section 6). Being at an intermediate =
stage, you should report here about the results achieved up to now in =
applying your approach that might not yet be sufficient for a full =
evaluation.

6.	Evaluation Plan
Describe your evaluation plan, which is the way you intend to validate =
your hypothesis, your results, and the value of your approach. For Early =
Stage PhD submissions, this might be only partially defined, and details =
might be omitted. For Late Stage PhD submissions, you might have partial =
evaluation results.

7.	Conclusions:
Describe how your results will or might impact research or the world at =
large.


Additional submission requirements:

* All submissions must be single-author submissions. The PhD advisor(s) =
and other contributors should be included only in the acknowledgements =
section.
* Authors of the accepted papers must register and present their work at =
the PhD Symposium, and must also present a poster at the regular ESWC =
poster session.
* Authors will have neither achieved their Ph.D. degree nor officially =
submitted their thesis at the time of submission to the PhD Symposium.
* PhD Symposium submissions are not regular research papers; the =
suggested proposal outline should be closely followed.


Accepted papers will be distributed to conference attendees and also =
appear in supplementary post-conference proceedings to be published by =
Springer in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).
