Context

Attributed network models have seen an increasing success in recent years,
thanks to their informative power and to their ability to model complex
networked relations that characterize most real-world phenomena. Their use
has been attractive to communities in different disciplines such as
computer science, physics, social science, as well as in interdisciplinary
research environments. The use of such models has been also supported by
the increasing easiness in collecting multi-relational data from the Web,
e.g., from online social media platforms, crowdsourced data, online
knowledge base. Within this view, the World Wide Web is an inestimable
source of information, which can be conveniently represented with
feature-rich network models, e.g., enclosing temporal aspects of the data,
quantitative and/or qualitative properties of nodes, different relations
between a common set of entities, different existence probabilities, or
modeling connection between different entity types.

The aim of the MATNet workshop, that will be held in conjunction with The
Web Conf 2018 in Lyon, is to get an insight in the current status of
research in network analysis and mining, showing how modeling information
coming from the World Wide Web in Attributed Network models can make it
possible to focus on domains and research questions that have not been
deeply investigated so far and to improve solutions to classic tasks. We
will solicit contributions that aim to focus on the analysis of attributed
networks, addressing important principles, methods, tools and future
research directions in this emerging field, possibly being  transversal to
different application domains. In particular, we cover the modeling of
complex networks, multiplex networks, and any unsupervised, supervised, and
semi-supervised mining approach in attributed network contexts.

- Models and measures for multiplex  & attributed networks.
