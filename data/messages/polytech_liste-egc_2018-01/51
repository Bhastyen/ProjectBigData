Call For Papers: APWeb-WAIM 2018 [Deadline Extended]

The Asia Pacific Web (APWeb) and Web-Age Information Management (WAIM) 
Joint Conference on Web and Big Data is aiming at attracting 
professionals of different communities related to Web and Big Data who 
have common interests in interdisciplinary research to share and 
exchange ideas, experience and the underlying techniques and 
applications, including Web technologies, database systems, information 
management, software engineering and big data.?

APWeb and WAIM are two separated leading international conferences on 
research, development and applications of Web technologies and database 
systems. Previous APWeb conferences were held in Beijing (1998), Hong 
Kong (1999), Xi°Øan (2000), Changsha (2001), Xi°Øan (2003), Hangzhou 
(2004), Shanghai (2005), Harbin (2006), Huangshan (2007), Shenyang 
(2008), Suzhou (2009), Busan (2010), Beijing (2011), Kunming (2012), 
Sydney (2013), Changsha(2014), Guangzhou (2015), and Suzhou (2016). 
Previous WAIM conferences were held in Shanghai (2000), Xi°Øan (2001), 
Beijing (2002), Chendu (2003), Dalian (2004), Hangzhou (2005), Hong Kong 
(2006), Huang shan (2007), Zhangjiajie (2008), Suzhou (2009), Jiuzhaigou 
(2010), Wuhan (2011), Harbin (2012), Beidaihe (2013), Macau (2014), 
Qingdao (2015), Nanchang (2016) and Beijing (2017).

Starting in 2017, the two conference committees have agreed to launch a 
joint conference. With the increased focus on Big Data, the new joint 
conference is expected to attract more professionals from different 
industrial and academic communities, not only from the Asia Pacific 
countries but also from other continents.

The second APWeb-WAIM joint conference on Web and Big Data 2018 will 
take place in Macau SAR.?

conference and one volume for the workshops. Both will be indexed by EI. 
All the best papers and a few selected papers will be recommended to 
special issues of World Wide Web: Internet and Web Information Systems 
(WWWJ), and Data Science and Engineering (DSE).?



Paper Submission?
Submissions must not exceed 15 pages in LNCS format, including 
references. All submissions must be in PDF format. Authors should avoid 
the use of non-English fonts to avoid problems with printing and viewing 
the submissions. All accepted papers MUST follow strictly the 
instructions for LNCS Authors. Springer LNCS site offers style files and 
information:?

http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0p?

APWEB/WAIM 2018 will employ double-blind reviewing process, every 
research paper submitted to APWEB/WAIM 2018 will undergo a 
"double-blind" reviewing process: the PC members and referees who review 
the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity 
of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows:?


°Ò Authors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or 
elsewhere in the paper.?
°Ò Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or 
elsewhere in the paper.?
°Ò Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must 
not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.?
°Ò The paper's file name must not identify the authors of the paper. It 
is strongly suggested that the submitted file be named with the assigned 
submission number. For example, if your assigned paper number is 352, 
then name your submission file 352.pdf.?
°Ò Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying 
the authors' name in the paper's associated metadata. For example, if 
your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi 
file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking 
into the PDF file.?

It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve 
anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise 
potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate 
rejection.?


All papers should be submitted through the Conference Management Tool at:?
