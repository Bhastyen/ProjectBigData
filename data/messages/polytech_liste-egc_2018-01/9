* Postdoctoral position in graph data-mining and its application in chemoin=
formatics at the University Of Caen (starting from February 1, 2018)=20

* Keywords: data-mining, machine learning, graph edit distance, chemoinform=
atics, graph algorithms=20

* General Description:=20

The Research Group in Computer Science, Image, Control and Electronics of C=
aen (GREYC) recruits a postdoctoral researcher in graph data-mining and its=
 application in chemoinformatics. The work will be carried out in the GREYC=
 lab., in a close collaboration with Bertrand Cuissart (CoDaG team) and Luc=
 Brun (Image team). The researcher will be a member of a computer science r=
esearch project that implies chemoinformaticians (Centre d'Etudes et de Rec=
herche sur le M=C3=A9dicaments de Normandie, COBRA) and computer scientists=
 from the LITIS lab. in Rouen.=20

In biomedical sciences, the postgenomic era is characterized by a substanti=
al production of experimental data. By analyzing these collected data, one =
aims to extract new pieces of information, the latter being critical to tac=
kle complex diseases such as cancers. This goal motivates the design of alg=
orithms fitted to extract relevant statistical associations between chemica=
l/biological features and a given activity. In this project, we will primar=
ily focus on studying the possible affinity between a small molecule (a lig=
and) and a protein. Specifically, we will concentrate on the (graph) edit d=
istance, its computation and its capacity to capture changes in ligand-prot=
ein affinity.=20

The objective is to design an algorithm that computes statistical associati=
ons by mining the edit paths between descriptions of molecules. Stress will=
 be put on the experimental evaluation. A particular attention will be paid=
 to the dissemination through scientific publications.=20
Feel free to contact bertrand.cuissart@unicaen.fr for any additional inform=
ation.=20


* Application requirements:=20
** a PhD degree in Computer Science,=20
** We welcome applications from candidates with a background in at least on=
e the following fields: in data mining, machine learning, combinatorial alg=
orithms (graph algorithms) or chemoinformatics.=20
Besides a sound experience of programming will be appreciated.=20

* Description:=20
** 20 months contract,=20
** Net salary: 2 200 =E2=82=AC/month, social security included.=20

* Screening of applications starts immediately and continues until the posi=
tion is filled.=20
Applications are to be submitted in PDF format via an email to Luc Brun (lu=
c.brun@ensicaen.fr) and Bertrand Cuissart (bertrand.cuissart@unicaen.fr), e=
nclosing=20
** a cover letter including names of at least two references and a research=
 plan (1 page suffices),=20
** a curriculum vitae,=20
** a complete list of publications, and up to three most relevant publicati=
ons=20
