*** IMPORTANT: Paper submission extended to February 1st 2018 ***

     Call for papers IJCNN 2018 special cross-disciplinary session on
“Interactive/Multiple Clustering using Evolutionary Computation,
Fuzzy, Machine Learning and/or Neural Networks” at
IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence
    08-13 July 2018, Windsor Convention Centre, Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL

                  http://www.ecomp.poli.br/~wcci2018/

Organized by Marcilio de Souto (University of Orleans, France), Andre
de Carvalho (University of São Paulo, Brazil), Christel Vrain
(University of Orleans, France), and Guillaume Cleuziou (University of
Orleans, France)

Clustering is a well-studied domain. Currently, more and more data are
collected from multiple sources or represented by multiple views
(e.g., text, video, images, biological data, among others). Also, for
the same data there might exist several different structures
(clusterings) which are meaningful for the user. In this context,
clustering techniques are often required to be able to provide several
possibilities for analyzing the data. As a consequence, in recent
years, the interdisciplinary research topic on multiple clusterings
has drawn significant attention of the data mining community.

Another topic of recent interest in clustering is interactive
clustering. For instance, usually clustering is studied in the
unsupervised learning framework. However, as pointed out in some
studies, in several real-world problems, such as personalized
recommendations, it is not possible to reach the “optimal” clustering
(the solution that meets the requirements of the user) without
interacting with the end user. In order to approach this problem,
recently frameworks for interactive clustering with human in the loop
have been proposed. These algorithms can interact with the human in
steps and receive feedback to improve.

The aim of this special session is to bring together researchers from
Machine Learning and Data Mining which are actively working in the
fields of multiple clusterings and interactive clustering. The idea is
to cover a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from multi-view
clustering, the interaction with human supervisors to constraint-based
clustering, and stimulate cross-fertilization. In this context, as it
is a cross-disciplinary session, we welcome papers in which techniques
such machine learning, neural networks, fuzzy systems and evolutionary
computing are used in the context of Interactive/Multiple Clustering.

In particular, we welcome contributions that address aspects
including, but not limited to:

·      Cluster ensemble and   Multi-view clustering:
·       How to combine/merge different clustering, how to control/force the disagreement/diversity between distinct clusterings, how to choose a solution among too many possible ones, how to represent/visualize a set of solutions.
·      Multi-objective clustering.
·      Multiple clustering solutions from very high dimensional and
complex databases.
·      Constraint-based clustering and applications as, for instance,
alternative clustering.
·      New approaches to interactive clustering
·      Methodologies for the evaluation of interactive clustering, and comparative studies.
