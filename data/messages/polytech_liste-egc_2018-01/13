[Call for papers] Interdisciplinary Workshop on Recommender-Systems

Interdisciplinary Workshop on Recommender Systems (a track of Digital 
Tools & Uses - Congress, Oct. 2018, Paris)
2nd edition of the international conference

Track chairs:
- Gérald Kembellec (Cnam, France)
- Raphaël Fournier-S’niehotta (Cnam, France)
- Fatma Siala Kallel (ISAM Manouba, Tunisia)

Short description

Recommender Systems (RS) reach their maturity with undeniable ubiquity 
both on social media, in collaborative platforms or online sales. After 
three interdisciplinary workshops devoted to the subject (in 2012, 2015 
and 2017), we are pleased to invite you to contribute to an 
interdisciplinary workshop on recommender systems to be held in Paris in 
october 2018.

Call for papers

Recommender systems are a central topic of study in several fields: from 
computer science to marketing through to information science. Both in 
academia and industry, there are a great variety of technical aspects to 
explore in recommender systems studies, such as machine learning, text 
mining, artificial intelligence (AI), network analysis, bibliometrics, 
databases, cloud computing, scalability, data science, visualization and 
human computer interaction (HCI). The motivation to organize InWoRS is 
to contrast points of view around Recommender Systems to generate 
fruitful collaborations and exchanges, in order to enrich the 
comprehension of RS for practitioners of the above-mentioned fields.

Topics

We welcome interesting, high standard contributions from all the fields 
studying Recommender Systems but will consider preferentially articles 
dealing with the following topics :

- RS for e-Learning
- RS and marketing
- RS algorithms and optimization
- RS and law, ethics & standards, with the use of massive social data
- RS in human resources context
- RS and strategy
- RS for scholar literature (new topic)
