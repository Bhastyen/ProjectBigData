The 7th International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Computing for 
Large Scale Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics

May 21, 2018
Vancouver, British Columbia CANADA
http://parlearning.ecs.fullerton.edu
In Conjunction with 32nd IEEE International Parallel & Distributed 
Processing Symposium.

Scaling up machine-learning (ML), data mining (DM) and reasoning 
algorithms from Artificial Intelligence (AI) for massive datasets is a 
major technical challenge in the time of "Big Data". The past ten years 
have seen the rise of multi-core and GPU based computing. In parallel 
and distributed computing, several frameworks such as OpenMP, OpenCL, 
and Spark continue to facilitate scaling up ML/DM/AI algorithms using 
higher levels of abstraction. We invite novel works that advance the 
trio-fields of ML/DM/AI through development of scalable algorithms or 
computing frameworks. Ideal submissions should describe methods for 
scaling up X using Y on Z, where potential choices for X, Y and Z are 
provided below.

Scaling up
•    Recommender systems
•    Optimization algorithms (gradient descent, Newton methods)
•    Deep learning
•    Sampling/sketching techniques
•    Clustering (agglomerative techniques, graph clustering, clustering 
heterogeneous data)
•    Classification (SVM and other classifiers)
•    SVD and other matrix computations
•    Probabilistic inference (Bayesian networks)
•    Logical reasoning
•    Graph algorithms/graph mining and knowledge graphs
•    Semi-supervised learning
•    Online/streaming learning
•    Generative adversarial networks

Using
•    Parallel architectures/frameworks (OpenMP, OpenCL, OpenACC, Intel 
TBB)
•    Distributed systems/frameworks (GraphLab, Hadoop, MPI, Spark)
•    Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Theano, Caffe)

On
•    Clusters of conventional CPUs
•    Many-core CPU (e.g. Xeon Phi)
•    FPGA
•    Specialized ML accelerators (e.g. GPU and TPU)


IMPORTANT DATES
•    Paper submission: February 16, 2018 AoE
•    Notification: March 16, 2018
•    Camera Ready: March 30, 2018


PAPER GUIDELINES

Submitted manuscripts should be upto 10 single-spaced double-column 
pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference 
style), including figures, tables, and references. Format requirements 
are posted on the IEEE IPDPS web page.
All submissions must be uploaded electronically at TBA
