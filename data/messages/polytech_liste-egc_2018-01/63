Special Issue on "Context-aware data access over social media streams"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 


Deadline extension >>> January 30 2018

AIMS AND SCOPE
--------------------------
Social media streams delivered by an increasing number of social 
platforms (e. g. Twitter, Facebook) provide an immense framework for 
intelligence gathering supporting a wide range of highly useful services 
such as crisis management, health-care monitoring and market research. 
Effective and efficient access to social data streams is an essential 
step for many such services. However, traditional access methods are no 
longer able to cope with the complexity of social streaming data. 
Indeed, unlike traditional web content, social media streams pose a 
number of issues mainly including large data volumes, high performance 
requirement, brevity, noise, multilingual form, temporality and 
dynamicity. This creates an opportunity, particularly for information 
retrieval and database communities, to revisit their vision about data 
access. One research direction we focus on in this special issue is the 
leveraging of contextual data to better understanding and processing 
streaming data. This last decade, context features such as user’s search 
history, preferences, location, and devices have become prevalent in 
various domains of information access. More particularly, social media 
streams give rise to new challenges represented by the generation of 
dynamic contextual features such as social interactions, timely updates, 
user’s evolving topics and opinions, user’s characteristics (e. g. 
influence, trust), the diversity of their forms (meta data, text, image) 
as well as their semantic-related interdependence. Dealing with those 
challenges will require the development of novel models, techniques, and 
tools for ensuring effective and efficient information access systems.
The objective of this special issue is to present recent research works 
concerning context-based data and information access over social media 
streams. Original papers preferably but not limited to the following 
topics are welcome:

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

-    Query rewriting, reranking, building context-driven views to 
support access to data streams
-    Using knowledge bases and open data for enhancing data streams 
informativeness
-    Temporal, continous and location-based querying
-    Modeling evolving profiles from social data streams: geo-locating 
users, inferring personal metadata (eg. personality, gender, interests, 
authority)
-    Building temporal and dynamic summaries of data streams
-    Cost models and optimization for efficient access to data streams
-    Performance evaluation and benchmarking of streaming data access tasks
-    Applications (crisis management, health care monitoring, 
smart-cities, political analysis)
