ESWC Conference:

ESWC is one of the key academic conferences to present research results =
and new developments in the area of the Semantic Web. For its 15th =
edition, ESWC will be back in Heraklion (Crete, Greece) from Sunday 3rd =
June to Thursday 7th June 2018. ESWC2018 features three main tracks =
(Research, Resources, In-Use), introduces a novel fully open review =
policy, as well as alternative publishing and decentralisation measures. =
This is the first call for papers for each of the main tracks.

General Chair: Aldo Gangemi

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Call for Research Track Papers
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Scope and Topics

The goal of the Semantic Web is to create a network of data and =
knowledge that interconnect across the Web, and where both content and =
its meaning are manipulated by processes, services and applications. =
This endeavour naturally draws from and impacts on many disciplines of =
computing (and connected areas), related to data and information =
management, knowledge engineering, machine intelligence, human knowledge =
and languages, software services and applications. We are therefore =
seeking contribution to research at the intersection of the Semantic Web =
and these areas, as described in the 9 research tracks of the =
conferences.

In addition to the main focus on advances in Semantic Web research and =
technologies, ESWC 2018 is looking to broaden the Semantic Web research =
community=E2=80=99s understanding and focus on problems and areas that =
directly impact the development of the Semantic Web. Thus, the 15th =
edition of ESWC 2018 includes 2 additional research tracks: the =
Benchmarking and Empirical Evaluations track, and the Semantic Web for =
Science track.

The aim of the  Benchmarking and Empirical Evaluations track is to =
encourage the community to submit papers on results of empirical =
evaluations of state-of-the-art Semantic Web methods; extensive =
evaluation using existing benchmarks are expected. The papers of this =
track should follow the scientific method and ensure reproducibility of =
the reported results by using analytical modelling and statistical =
methods. Submissions could report on the verification or refutation of =
already published results, as well as the empirical comparison of =
state-of-the-art methods.=20

Moreover, in the Semantic Web for Science track, submissions presenting =
domain specific problems that require the use of Semantic Web =
technologies to be solved are expected. Biomedicine, pharmacogenomic, =
sociology, scholarly, maritime, or journalism are examples of scientific =
domains.  The introduction of this theme integrates well with and builds =
upon tracks of Semantic Data Management and Machine Learning, and allows =
for the submission of research papers where novel solutions for the =
management and analytics of scientific data are required.

Call for In-Use & Industrial Track Papers
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

The Semantic Web In-Use and Industry track provides a forum for =
researchers and industry to discuss novel research taken to the market, =
or on any other relevant uptake of semantic technologies outside the =
lab. Submissions to the track will provide a deeper insight on the =
exploitation of Semantic Web technologies in different sectors. The =
track takes a broad view of semantic technologies including natural =
language processing and machine learning techniques.

Papers will be evaluated on the basis of measurable impact of semantic =
technologies, and on the extent to which they address real-life =
problems. In addition, papers will be assessed on the novelty of the =
techniques applied in practice, and should include an evaluation of the =
technology or reflect on the pros and cons of the approach.=20

Topics:

- Best practices and lessons learnt from the use of semantic =
technologies in real-world settings
- Comparison of semantic technologies with alternative or conventional =
approaches
- Industry and business trends regarding the use of semantic =
technologies
- Ontology-based data access in large-scale and industrial systems
- Cloud Computing and Mobile apps based on semantic technologies
- Knowledge Graphs in real-world settings
- Semantic technologies and Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing and machine reading techniques applied in =
practice
- Sentiment Analysis and Social Networks in action
- Intelligent User Interfaces and Interaction paradigms for semantic =
applications
- Corporate Data and Knowledge Management over large, heterogeneous and =
diverse data; Semantic Big Data
- Semantic technologies and corporate data governance=20
- The use of Schema.org, microformats and other open markup languages =
and standards
- Security and Privacy issues in semantic applications
- Collaborative Content Management Systems, including Wikis
- Industry and Business Analytics solutions using semantic technology
- Internet of Things, sensor networks
- Applications in domain-specific areas such as Health & Life Sciences, =
Digital Libraries & Cultural Heritage, Media & Entertainment, Smart =
Cities, and Open Government

Call for Resources Track Papers
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Scope and Topics

Many of the research efforts in the areas of the Semantic Web and Linked =
Data focus on publishing scientific papers that prove a hypothesis. =
However, scientific advancement is often reliant on good quality =
resources, that provide the necessary scaffolding to support the =
scientific publications; yet the resources themselves rarely get the =
same recognition as the advances they facilitate. Sharing these =
resources and the best practices that have lead to their development =
with the research community is crucial, to consolidate research =
material, ensure reproducibility of results and in general gain new =
scientific insights.

The ESWC 2018 Resources Track aims to promote the sharing of resources =
including, but not restricted to: datasets, evaluation benchmarks and =
annotated corpora, ontologies and vocabularies, knowledge graphs of =
remarkable interest, machine learning models (e.g. embeddings) that are =
not trivial to (re-)train, software frameworks, tools, libraries and =
APIs attached to an open license, etc. In particular, we encourage the =
sharing of such resources following best and well established practices =
within the Semantic Web community, including the provision of an open =
license and a permalink identifying the resource. This track calls for =
contributions that provide a concise and clear description of a resource =
and its usage.=20

A typical Resource track paper may reporting on one of the following =
categories, though the list is not exhaustive:

- Ontologies developed for an application, with a focus on describing =
the modelling process underlying their creation and their usage;
- Datasets and annotated corpora produced to support specific evaluation =
tasks;
- Knowledge graphs or remarkable interest that comprehensively cover new =
vertical domains;
- Machine learning models that would impact the knowledge engineering =
community. Examples include comprehensive word embeddings trained on =
large corpora, models for computer vision such as Inception v3 or =
ResNet50, CRNN for music, etc. See also =
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine_learning_resear=
ch  =20
- Description of a reusable research prototype / service supporting =
research or applications;=20
- Description of community shared software frameworks that can be =
extended or adapted.

Specific Review Criteria for Resource Papers

The program committee will consider the quality of both the resource and =
 the paper in its review process. Therefore, authors must ensure =
unfettered access to the resource during the review process, ideally by =
the resource being cited at a permanent location specific for the =
resource. For example, data available in a repository such as FigShare, =
Zenodo, or a domain specific repository; or software code being =
available in public code repository such as GitHub or BitBucket. The =
resource MUST be publicly available.

We welcome the description of well established as well as emerging =
resources. Resources will be evaluated along the following generic =
review criteria that should be carefully considered both by authors and =
reviewers:

Potential impact:

- Does the resource break new ground?
- Does the resource plug an important gap?
- How does the resource advance the state of the art?
- Has the resource been compared to other existing resources (if any) of =
similar scope?
- Is the resource of interest to the Semantic Web community?
- Is the resource of interest to society in general?
- Will the resource have an impact, especially in supporting the =
adoption of Semantic Web technologies?
- Is the resource relevant and sufficiently general, does it measure =
some significant aspect?

Reusability:

- Is there evidence of usage by a wider community beyond the resource =
creators or their project? Alternatively, what is the resource=E2=80=99s =
potential for being (re)used; for example, based on the activity volume =
on discussion forums, mailing list, issue tracker, support portal, etc?
- Is the resource easy to (re)use?  For example, does it have good =
quality documentation? Are there tutorials availability? etc.
- Is the resource general enough to be applied in a wider set of =
scenarios, not just for the originally designed use?
- Is there potential for extensibility to meet future requirements?
- Does the resource clearly explain how others use the data and =
software?
- Does the resource description clearly state what the resource can and =
cannot do, and the rationale for the exclusion of some functionality?

Design & Technical quality:

- Does the design of the resource follow resource specific best =
practices?
- Did the authors perform an appropriate re-use or extension of suitable =
high-quality resources?  For example, in the case of ontologies, authors =
might  extend upper ontologies and/or reuse ontology design patterns.
- Is the resource suitable to solve the task at hand?
- Does the resource provide an appropriate description (both human and =
machine readable), thus encouraging the adoption of FAIR principles? Is =
there a schema diagram? For datasets, is the description available in =
terms of VoID/DCAT/DublinCore?
- If the resource proposes performance metrics, are such metrics =
sufficiently broad and relevant?
- If the resource is a comparative analysis or replication study, was =
the coverage of systems reasonable, or were any obvious choices missing?

Availability:

- Is the resource (and related results) published at a persistent URI =
(PURL, DOI, w3id)?
- Does the resource provide a licence specification? (See =
creativecommons.org, opensource.org for more information)
- How is the resource publicly available? For example as API, Linked =
Open Data, Download, Open Code Repository.
- Is the resource publicly findable? Is it registered in (community) =
registries (e.g. Linked Open Vocabularies, BioPortal, or DataHub)? Is it =
registered in generic repositories such as  FigShare, Zenodo or GitHub?
- Is there a sustainability plan specified for the resource? Is there a =
plan for the maintenance of the resource?
- Does it use open standards, when applicable, or have good reason not =
to?

Submission Information, Reviewing
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

ESWC 2018 welcomes the submission of original research and application =
papers dealing with all aspects of representing and using semantics on =
the Web. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and =
applications papers. Submitted papers should describe original work, =
present significant results, and provide rigorous, principled, and =
repeatable evaluation.=20
We strongly encourage and appreciate the submission of papers =
incorporating links to data sets and other material used for evaluation =
as well as to live demos and software source code.=20
ESWC will not accept papers that, at the time of submission, are under =
review for or have already been published in or accepted for publication =
in a journal, another conference, or another ESWC track. The conference =
organizers may share information on submissions with other venues to =
ensure that this rule is not violated.
The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer's =
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Decentralised publishing of =
pre- and post-prints e.g. along the lines of LORC and Linked Data =
Notifications (see https://linkedresearch.org/cloud) is strongly =
encouraged, and will be supported by a dedicated team.

Rules include:

- Pre-submission of abstracts is a strict requirement. All papers and =
abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair =
conference submission system. Abstracts alone will not be reviewed.
- Papers describing a resource must not exceed 15 pages (including =
references). Papers that exceed the page limit will be rejected without =
review.
- All research submissions must be in English.
- Submissions must be either in PDF or in HTML, formatted in the style =
of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer =
Science (LNCS). For details on the LNCS style, see Springer=E2=80=99s =
Author Instructions. For HTML submission guidance, see below, and the =
website.=20
- We encourage embedding metadata in the PDF/HTML to provide a machine =
readable link from the paper to the resource.
- Authors will have the opportunity to submit a rebuttal to the reviews =
to clarify questions posed by program committee members.
- Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic =
annotations for the abstract of their submission, which will be made =
available on the conference web site. Details will be provided at the =
time of acceptance.
- Accepted papers will be distributed to conference attendees and also =
published by Springer in the printed conference proceedings, as part of =
the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
- At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the =
conference and present the paper there.

Useful tips for HTML submissions
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *=20

The Research Articles in Simplified HTML (RASH) Framework provides a =
terse markup language for writing scientific articles in (X)HTML. It is =
possible to include also RDF statements as RDFa annotations and/or as =
Turtle, JSON-LD and RDF/XML triples by using the tag "script". Tools =
exist for converting RASH-compliant ODT or DOCX to LaTeX (see =
http://dasplab.cs.unibo.it/rocs).
Dokieli is a client-side editor for decentralized article publishing in =
HTML+RDFa, annotations and social interactions, compliant with the =
Linked Research initiative. There are a variety of examples available =
online https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/wiki#examples-in-the-wild, =
where the LNCS author guidelines as a template may be particularly =
useful.
Accepted papers for which there is an HTML version will be made =
available online through the ESWC website. For HTML submission, please =
submit a ZIP archive containing an HTML file with all the additional =
stylesheets and scripts for guaranteeing a correct visualization of the =
document in browsers.
For references, e.g. see the "Reference" section in =
https://datasciencehub.net/content/guidelines-authors.
Please note that independent of the format used, we require submissions =
to abide by the permitted number of pages, font sizes, font selection, =
margins, etc. This is to ensure visual consistency of the proceedings as =
well as to have comparative page limits.

Submissions and reviewing will be supported by the EasyChair system: =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Deswc2018=20

A Fully Open Review Policy
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

This year, the ESWC 2018 review process will be fully open. The basic =
principles are:

- The submitted papers will be publicly posted on the ESWC 2018 web site =
upon submission
- The authors will be known to reviewers (i.e., submissions are NOT =
anonymous)
- The reviewers will be known to authors by default. However, reviewers =
can also explicitly opt-out.
- The reviews and the rebuttal will be made publicly available upon =
final notification (post-rebuttal), including reviewer identity (unless =
they have opted out), both for the PC members (unless they have opted =
out) and the senior PC members (which cannot opt out).
- On explicit request made by the authors, the rejected papers and their =
reviews will be removed from the Web after the conference.
- For accepted papers, the reviews will stay online at least 12 months. =
They will be removed at the author=E2=80=99s requests after this embargo =
period.
- Upon posting submissions on the ESWC 2018 web site (point 1 above), =
any researcher can also contribute open reviews. Decentralisation will =
be handy here e.g. with openreview.org (for PDF) or hypothes.is or =
dokieli (for HTML), plus Linked Data Notifications.=
