                           META'2018
International Conference on Metaheuristics and Nature Inspired Computing

                          27-31 Oct 2018
                        Marrakech, Morocco

http://meta2018.sciencesconf.org/
**********************************************************************

META is one of the main event focusing on the progress of the area of 
metaheuristics and their applications. As in previous editions, 
META’2018 will provide an opportunity to the international research 
community in metaheuristics to discuss recent research results, to 
develop new ideas and collaborations, and to meet old friends and make 
new ones in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.

All selected papers will be published in the conference proceedings. 
Following the tradition, selected long papers will be published in a 
postponed Springer book as in META'2014 and META'2016.

At least, 2 special special issues in ISI and SCOPUS journals are also 
confirmed:
- Special issue in "Optimization and learning" in Wiley Journal ITOR - 
International Journal on Operational Research (deadline for submission: 
31 May 2018)
- Special issue in "Metaheuristics for 4.0 industry" in  Elsevier 
Journal Swarm-and-Evolutionary-Computation (deadline for submission: 31 
May 2018)

META'2018 welcomes presentations that cover any aspects of metaheuristic 
research such as new algorithmic developments, high-impact applications, 
new research challenges, theoretical developments, implementation 
issues, and in-depth experimental studies. META'2018 strives for a 
high-quality program that will be completed by a number of invited 
talks, tutorials, workshops and special sessions.

The scope of the META’2018 conference includes, but is not limited to:
     * Local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, VNS, ILS, …
     * Evolutionary algorithms, swarm optimization, scatter search, …
     * Emergent nature inspired algorithms: quantum computing, 
artificial immune systems, bee colony, DNA computing, …
     * Parallel algorithms
     * Hybrid methods with machine learning, game theory, mathematical 
programming, constraint programming, co-evolutionary, …
     * Application to: logistics and transportation, networks, 
scheduling, data mining, engineering design, energy, cloud, bio-medical, …
     * Theory of metaheuristics, landscape analysis, convergence, 
problem difficulty, very large neighbourhoods, …
     * Multi-objective optimization, bi-level optimization
     * Dynamic optimization, problems with uncertainty, …
     * Parameter tuning (static, dynamic, adaptive, self-adaptive)
     * Hyper-heuristics, cross-domain metaheuristics
     * Software frameworks for metaheuristics and nature inspired computing
