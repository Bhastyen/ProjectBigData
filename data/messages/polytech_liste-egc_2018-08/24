*Graph Embedding day 2018 - Lyon*

*September 7, 2018*

Graph Embedding is a recently introduced technique whose goal is to 
transform graph data into vector data by keeping some aspects of the 
graph structure.
Because it allows to apply all the range of data mining and machine 
learning techniques -that require vectors as input- to graph data, it 
has the potential to be a game changer in the related fields of graph 
mining/network analysis. Because the embedding of such a complex 
structure is a hard problem, it also represents a challenge in the field 
of machine learning itself, in line with recent works on word embedding 
(word2vec...)

The aim of this event is to have some of the most active international 
researchers in the field to present their recent works, their vision of 
the field and of its future.

*Program available at *http://ged2018.sci-web.net/index.html

**Registration is free but for logistic reasons, please let us know if 
you want to attend the workshop by sending a message at 
largeron@univ-st-etienne.fr
