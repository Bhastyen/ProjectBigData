Position announcement:

Fully funded 2-year full-time Postdoc research position
In Big Data/AI applied to Managerial Cognitions
jointly between the MIDI team of the ETIS Lab UMR 8051
and the Management Department of ESSEC Business School

OBJECTIVE
This postdoctoral project will take an innovative multidisciplinary
approach by developing Big Data/AI based techniques to study managerial
cognitions in the field.

CONTEXT
Computer Sciences/Big Data/AI
Techniques and methods to be developed belong to the following Big Data
/AI areas of current computer science research:
* modelling and capturing of opinions/beliefs using Big Data, Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods,
* learning from natural data sources (e.g., online discussions)
* information diffusion, opinion dynamics and social networks

Substantive Application: Management Cognitions
Entrepreneurs tend to share their points of view on how to manage their
firm, for instance by expressing their beliefs on Twitter, which
constitute =C3=92theory of action=C3=93. If we assume a limited set of su=
ch higher
order keystone theories have a significant effect on actors=C3=95 activit=
ies
and actions, the determination of such set is a hard combinatorial
problem. Conceptually, it may be resolved in the field by =C3=92social
calculations=C3=93, those iterative rounds of communication, enactment an=
d
selection of beliefs among a large population of entrepreneurs. Because
of this process of emergence, belief about theories of action should
therefore exhibit particular properties (e.g., polymorphous) and follow
particular dynamics (e.g., phase transitions). So far, those properties
have not been verified in the field, beyond conducting limited manual
qualitative analyses.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
Substantive Application
We plan to capture and model the belief system of entrepreneurs as they
are shared in social media or other communication means. This should
allow to verify and further elaborate on the properties and dynamics of
beliefs system in communities of entrepreneurs, in particular through
non-linear modelling (phase transitions, interactions). This would
provide information on their validity and robustness. There is also
great potential if such analyses can be extended to other managerial
contexts, for instance to the belief system of employees inside a firm,
using data sources such as email trails.

Computer Science/Big Data/AI
Modelling and capturing opinions and their evolution in a managerial
context is a new exciting area of interdisciplinary research. The work
will combine properties arising from the social (online and
professional) networks of the management personnel with text analytical
functions in order to form a model of beliefs (opinions) and then track
the evolution of this model through subsequent interactions. We plan to
do this through a series of learning and mining tasks over dynamic data,
since we are interested in capturing the temporal aspects of such models.

The main objective of the postdoc will be to complete studies pushing
the boundary of Big Data/AI techniques in order to better understand
managerial cognitions. Besides the usual publishing of research papers
in high-end journals/conferences both in Big Data/AI and management
studies (in collaboration with the study's PIs, Profs. Kotzinos &
Cavarretta). We would like to also present at the end a toolkit that
would allow us to repeat such studies in the future.
REQUIREMENTS
* The applicant should have successfully defended a PhD in computer
science, big data, machine learning, data science or related field.
Applicants that will defend their PhDs before or around the beginning of
the project (11/2018) are also welcome to apply.
* The applicant should demonstrate ability and experience in developing
applications to execute applied computer science projects. Experience in
tools used for big data analytics (in R, Python, Java or all) is a plus
(additionally if applied in a cloud environment).
* Language: the working language will be English

LOCATION
Cergy-Pontoise (suburb of Paris France)

INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT
The funding for this research is provided by Paris Seine Initiative of
Excellence. We expect the successful applicant to be one of the driving
forces behind the newly established collaboration between the two
entities mentioned above. The postdoc will be affiliated and located in
the ETIS lab at the University of Cergy-Pontoise, and will work jointly
with both Professor Fabrice Cavarretta (ESSEC Business School) and
Professor Dimitris Kotzinos (ETIS / Paris Seine University) and their
respective groups.

TENTATIVE STARTING DATE:
November 2018 or as soon as possible thereafter.

APPLICATION
If interested, please send your application (including a detailed CV,
university transcripts, a copy of the PhD thesis and/or scientific
papers if available, as well as a list of personal references and a
motivation letter) in PDF format to Professor Dimitris Kotzinos
(Dimitrios.Kotzinos@u-cergy.fr) and cc: Professor Fabrice Cavarretta
(cavarretta@essec.edu) with title =C3=92Postdoc INEX=C3=93. Further infor=
mal
enquiries are also welcome.

Applications will be welcome until the position is filled, those
submitted before 15/09/2018 will be considered in priority.
