************************************************
Second CALL FOR PAPERS
/grafematik/
Graphemics in the 21st century---=46rom graphemes to knowledge
<http://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/grafematik/>

Contact: info-grafematik-2018@mlistes.telecom-bretagne.eu
************************************************
=20
/grafematik/ 2018 is the first conference bringing together disciplines =
concerned with writing systems and their representation in written =
communication. The conference aims to reflect on the current state of =
research in the area, and on the role that writing and writing systems =
play in neighboring disciplines like computer science and information =
technology, communication, typography, psychology, and pedagogy. In =
particular it aims to study the effect of the growing importance of =
Unicode with regard to the future of reading and writing in human =
societies. Reflecting the richness of perspectives on writing systems, =
/grafematik/ is actively interdisciplinary, and welcomes proposals from =
researchers from the fields of computer science and information =
technology, linguistics, communication, pedagogy, psychology, history, =
and the social sciences.=20
=20
/grafematik/ aims to create a space for the discussion of the range of =
approaches to writing systems, and specifically to bridge approaches in =
linguistics, informatics, and other fields. It will provide a forum for =
explorations in terminology, methodology, and theoretical approaches =
relating to the delineation of an emerging interdisciplinary area of =
research that intersects with intense activity in practical =
implementations of writing systems.
=20
***********************
Main topics of interest
***********************
=20
We welcome proposals from all disciplines concerned with the study of =
written language, writing systems, and their implementation in =
information systems. Examples of topics include, but are not limited to:
=20
Epistemology of graphemics: history, onomastics, topics, interaction =
with other disciplines
Foundations of graphemics
History and typology of writing systems, comparative graphemics
Semiotics of writing and of writing systems
Computational/formal graphemics
Graphemic theory of Unicode encoding
Graphemics as part of linguistics, in particular: graphemics vs. =
phonology
Orthographic reforms, theory and practice
Graphemics and multiliteracy
Sinographemics
Typographemics and interaction of typography and graphemics
Texting, latinization, new forms of written language
ASCII art, emoticons and other pictorial uses of graphemes
The future of writing, of writing systems and styles
Graphemics and font technologies
Graphemics in steganography and computer security (phishing, =
typosquatting, etc.)
Graphemics in media and communication / Aesthetics of writing in the =
digital era
Graphemics in experimental psychology and cognitive sciences
Teaching graphemics, the five Ws and one H
Applications of graphemics in natural language processing and text =
mining
Applications of graphemics in optical character recognition and =
information technologies
