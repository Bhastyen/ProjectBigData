=C2=B7      NETWORK THEORY : THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD

Network theory has emerged almost twenty years ago, as a new field for
characterizing interacting complex systems, such as the Internet, the
biological networks of the cell, and social networks. This tutorial will
provide a (personal) reflection on the maturity of the field, indicating
the main results obtained so far and the big challenges that lie ahead. The
hot topics that will be critically discussed include: multilayer networks,
network geometry and percolation theory.



*Ginestra Bianconi is Associate Professor (Reader) and Director of the MSc
in Network Science at the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary
University of London, London, UK. Her research activity on network science
includes network theory and its applications and has appeared in journal
such as Science, PNAS, PRX and Physical Review Letters. In the last years
her work have focused on multilayer networks, network geometry, percolation
and network control.*



=C2=B7      MINING INFORMATION PROPAGATION DATA

With the success of online social networks and microblogging platforms such
as Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter, the phenomenon of influence-driven
propagations, has recently attracted the interest of computer scientists,
sociologists, information technologists, and marketing specialists. In this
talk we will take a data mining perspective, discussing what (and how) can
be learned from a social network and a database of traces of past
propagations over the social network. Starting from one of the key problems
in this area, i.e. the identification of influential users, we will provide
a brief overview of our recent contributions in this area. We will expose
the connection between the phenomenon of information propagation and the
existence of communities in social network, and we will go deeper in this
new research topic arising at the overlap of information propagation
analysis and community detection.



*Francesco Bonchi is Research Leader at the ISI Foundation, Turin, Italy,
where he's the head of the "Algorithmic Data Analytics" group. He is also
(part-time) Principal Scientist for Data Mining at Eurecat (Technological
Center of Catalunya),Barcelona. *

*Before he was Director of Research at Yahoo Labs in Barcelona, Spain,
where he was leading the Web Mining Research group. His recent research
interests include mining query-logs, social networks, and social media, as
well as the privacy issues related to mining these kinds of sensible data.
In the past he has been interested in data mining query languages,
constrained pattern mining, mining spatiotemporal and mobility data, and
privacy preserving data mining. *

*He is member of the ECML PKDD Steering Committee, Associate Editor of the
newly created IEEE Transactions on Big Data (TBD), of the IEEE Transactions
on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), the ACM Transactions on
Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), Knowledge and Information
Systems (KAIS), and member of the Editorial Board of Data Mining and
Knowledge Discovery (DMKD). He has been program co-chair of the European
Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge
Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD 2010). Dr. Bonchi has also served as
program co-chair of the 28th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia (HT
2017), the 16th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2016),
the first and second ACM SIGKDD International Workshop on Privacy,
Security, and Trust in KDD (PinKDD 2007 and 2008), the 1st IEEE
International Workshop on Privacy Aspects of Data Mining (PADM 2006), and
the 4th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Inductive
Databases (KDID 2005). He is co-editor of the book "Privacy-Aware Knowledge
Discovery: Novel Applications and New Techniques" published by Chapman &
Hall/CRC Press. He earned his Ph.D. in computer science from the University
of Pisa in December 2003.*
