Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: BPM 2018 (16th International Conference on
 Business Process Management)

---------------------------

BPM 2018 - 16th International Conference on Business Process Management
Call for Papers

September 9-14, 2018, Sydney, Australia.

http://bpm2018.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/

---------------------------

The annual BPM conference is the premium forum for researchers and=20
practitioners in business process management. BPM is a broad discipline,=20
covering topics that range from formal methods in computer science to=20
techniques in information systems engineering, to management science=20
methods. Therefore, not only different research topics are addressed,=20
but also different research methods are employed that require different=20
evaluation criteria in the peer reviewing process.

To accommodate for this diversity, the BPM conference introduces a new=20
structure. This structure is based on three tracks that cover not only=20
different phenomena of interest and research methods but, consequently,=20
also different evaluation criteria. To implement this structure, each=20
track has a dedicated track chair and a dedicated program committee. The=20
track chairs, together with a consolidation chair, are responsible for=20
the scientific program. Through this new structure we aim to broaden the=20
BPM community and position the BPM conference as a forum for all aspects=20
of the broad business process management discipline.

TRACK I: FOUNDATIONS

Track I invites papers that follow computer science research methods.=20
This includes papers that investigate the underlying principles of BPM=20
systems, computational theories, algorithms, and methods for modeling=20
and analyzing business processes. This track also covers papers on novel=20
languages, architectures, and other concepts underlying process aware=20
information systems, as well as papers that use conceptual modeling=20
techniques to investigate problems in the design and analysis of BPM=20
systems. Papers in Track I are evaluated according to computer science=20
standards, including sound formalization, convincing argumentation, and,=20
where applicable, proof of concept implementation, which shows that the=20
concepts can be implemented as described. Since papers typically do not=20
have an immediate application in concrete business environments,=20
empirical evaluation does not play a major role in Track I.


You should send your paper to Track I if:

- It provides foundational results about the underlying principles and=20
concepts of BPM systems.

- It advances the state of the art in BPM through the investigation of=20
formal methods and algorithms.

- It contributes to the definition of novel concepts, languages, and=20
architectures for BPM systems.

- It tackles conceptual modelling issues of BPM systems and their=20
environment.

- It investigates novel concepts of BPM systems through the development=20
of proof-of-concept implementations.

Track Chair: Marco Montali

Senior PC: Florian Daniel, Dirk Fahland, Giancarlo Guizzardi, Thomas=20
Hildebrandt, Marcello La Rosa, John Mylopoulos, Manfred Reichert,=20
Jianwen Su, Hagen V=C3=B6lzer, Matthias Weidlich.



TRACK II: ENGINEERING

Track II invites papers that follow information systems engineering=20
methods. The focus is on the investigation of artifacts and systems in=20
business environments, following the design science approach. Papers in=20
this track are expected to have a strong empirical evaluation that=20
critically tests criteria like usefulness or added value of the proposed=20
artifact. This track covers business process intelligence, including=20
process mining techniques, and the use of process models for enactment,=20
model-driven engineering, as well as interaction with services and=20
deployment architectures like the Cloud. It also covers BPM systems in=20
particular domains, such as digital health, smart mobility, or Internet=20
of Things. Empirical evaluations are important to show the merits of the=20
artifact introduced. A self-critical discussion of threats to validity=20
is expected. Formalization of problems and solutions should be used=20
where they add clarity or are beneficial in other ways.

You should send your paper to Track II if:

- It has a significant technical contribution.

- Its results are empirically evaluated.

- It reports on a system that you designed, with a maturity of at least=20
a prototype. i.e., it can be evaluated in an application context.

- It follows the design science approach.

Track Chair: Ingo Weber

Senior PC: Wil van der Aalst, Boualem Benatallah, Boudewijn van Dongen,=20
Jan Mendling, Cesare Pautasso, Hajo Reijers, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Pnina=20
Soffer, Barbara Weber, Jianmin Wang


TRACK III: MANAGEMENT

Track III invites papers that aim at advancing our understanding of how=20
BPM can deliver business value, for instance how it builds=20
organizational capabilities to improve, innovate or transform the=20
respective business. Papers that study the application and impact of BPM=20
methods and tools in use contexts based on empirical observation are=20
highly welcome.

Areas of interest include a wide range of capability areas that are=20
relevant for BPM, such as strategic alignment, governance, methods,=20
information technology, and human aspects including people and culture.=20
We seek contributions that advance our understanding on how=20
organizations can develop such capabilities in order to achieve specific=20
objectives in given organizational contexts. Papers may use various=20
strategies of inquiry, including case study research, action research,=20
focus group research, big data analytics research, neuroscience=20
research, econometric research, literature review research, survey=20
research or design science research. Papers will be evaluated according=20
to management and information systems standards.

Authors of selected papers in this track will be invited to submit=20
revised and extended versions of their work for a special issue in the=20
European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS) on =E2=80=9CBusiness Proce=
ss=20
Management and Digital Innovation=E2=80=9D.

You should send your paper to Track III if:

- It makes a contribution to an organizational challenge.

- It builds on and draws from real-world organizational endeavors in BPM.

- It extends the BPM body of knowledge to better contribute to strategy=20
delivery.

- It advances our understanding and methodology of BPM to support=20
digital innovation.

- It contributes to solving grand societal challenges through BPM.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Each paper will be submitted to exactly one track. Please use the track=20
descriptions above to decide where to send your paper. Authors may=20
contact track chairs for clarification. Papers must be formatted=20
according to Springer's LNCS formatting guidelines. Submissions must be=20
in English and must not exceed 16 pages. The title page must contain a=20
short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics=20
above. The paper must clearly state the problem being addressed, the=20
goal of the work, the results achieved, and the relation to other work.=20
Student papers are treated as regular papers in the review process.=20
Importantly, the contribution underlying a student paper must be carried=20
out mainly by the student(s), but others (advisors, collaborators, etc.)=20
can appear as authors as well. When submitting the paper, student papers=20
must be clearly marked as such in the EasyChair system. To be eligible=20
for the best student paper award, student papers have to be presented at=20
the conference by a student author.

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the BPM 2018=20
EasyChair submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dbpm2=
018.

Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been=20
published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals=20
while being submitted to BPM 2018. Authors are encouraged to adhere to=20
the best practices of Reproducible Research (RR), by making available=20
data and software tools for reproducing the results reported in their=20
papers.

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published=20
by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. For each=20
accepted paper, at least one author must register for the conference and=20
present the paper. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit=20

ystems=20
(Tracks I and II) and in Palgrave=E2=80=99s European Journal of Informati=
on=20
Systems (Track III).

The BPM Forum will host innovative research which has high potential of=20
stimulating discussion at the conference but does not fully meet the=20
quality criteria for the main conference. Those papers will be invited=20
to the BPM Forum and published in full length in a separate=20
post-proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Business Information=20
Processing series, as well as being presented during the main=20
conference. There will not be short papers at the conference.

First-time submitters to BPM may request to be considered for a=20
pre-submission shepherding program in which a selected BPM PC member=20
advises on the presentation and positioning of a shepherded paper.=20
Interested candidates are encouraged to contact the PC Chairs=20
