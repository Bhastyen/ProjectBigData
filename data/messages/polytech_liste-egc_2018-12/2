About ICCS:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The International Conferences on Conceptual Structures (ICCS) focus on =
the formal analysis and representation of conceptual knowledge, at the =
crossroads of artificial intelligence, human cognition, computational =
linguistics, and related areas of computer science and cognitive =
science. The ICCS conferences evolved from a series of seven annual =
workshops on conceptual graphs, starting with an informal gathering =
hosted by John F. Sowa in 1986. Recently, graph-based knowledge =
representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigms are getting more and more =
attention.  With the rise of quasi-autonomous AI, graph-based =
representations provide a vehicle for making machine cognition explicit =
to its human users. Conversely, graphical and graph-based models can =
provide a rigorous way of expressing intuitive notions in computable =
frameworks. The aim of the ICCS 2019 conference is to build upon its =
long standing expertise in graph-based KRR and focus on providing =
modelling, formal and application results of graph-based systems.

The conference welcomes contributions from a modelling, application and =
theoretical viewpoint:

- Modelling results will investigate concrete real world needs for =
graph-based representation,
for example (but not limited to) how human cognition can be mapped onto =
and facilitated by graphical representations, how certain use cases are =
of interest to the graph community, how using graphs can bring added =
(business) value, what kind of graph representation is needed for a =
given case, etc.

- Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to =
demonstrate the benefits of the graph-based proposed solutions in the =
context of the use case studied. Where appropriate, the graph-based =
solutions are compared to other possible solutions.

- Technical results will include fundamental graph theory based results =
for novel structures for representation, extensions of existing =
structures for added expressivity, conciseness, optimisation algorithms =
for reasoning, reasoning explanation, etc.
