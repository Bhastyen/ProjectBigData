Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW 2016, Submission Due Feb.24)

Welcome to the 2016 Pacific Rim Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW
2016) to be held at Phuket, Thailand on August 22-23, 2016. Over the past two
decades, PKAW has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners
working in the area of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence.
In 2016, PKAW 2016 will be held as part of the 14th Pacific Rim
International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2016).
The purpose of this workshop is to provide a chance for intensive
discussion on the aspects of knowledge acquisition.

In recent years, unprecedented data, called big data, has become available
and knowledge acquisition and learning from big data is increasing in
importance. Various knowledge can be acquired not only from human
experts but also from diverse data. Simultaneous acquisition from both
data and human experts increases its importance. Multidisciplinary
research including knowledge engineering, machine learning, natural
language processing, human computer interaction, and artificial
intelligence are required. We invite authors to submit papers on all
aspects of these area.

Another important and related area is applications. Not only in
the engineering field but also in the social science field (e.g., economics,
social networks, and sociology), recent progress of knowledge
acquisition and data engineering techniques is realizing interesting
applications. We also invite submissions that present applications
tested and deployed in real-life settings. Those papers should address
lessons learned from application development and deployment.

All papers will be peer reviewed, and those accepted for the workshop
will be included in the Springer LNAI proceedings.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
     Papers are invited for consideration in all aspects of knowledge
     acquisition, engineering and management for intelligent systems,
     including (but not restricted to):

     - Fundamental views on knowledge that affect the knowledge acquisition process and the use of knowledge in knowledge engineering
     - Algorithmic approaches to knowledge acquisition
     - Tools and techniques for knowledge acquisition, knowledge maintenance and knowledge validation
     - Evaluation of knowledge acquisition techniques, tools and methods
     - Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modelling information systems or decision support systems
     - Methods and techniques for sharing and reusing knowledge
     - Ontology and its role in knowledge acquisition
     - Mining the Semantic Web, the Linked Data and the Web of Data
     - Hybrid approaches combining knowledge engineering and machine learning
     - Innovative user interfaces
     - Big data capture, representation and analytics
     - Crowd-sourcing for data generation and problem solving
     - Software engineering and knowledge engineering
     - Algorithms, tools and techniques for machine intelligence
     - Knowledge acquisition applications tested and deployed in in real-life settings
