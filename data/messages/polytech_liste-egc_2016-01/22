WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science=20
conferences. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present=20
their state-of-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to examine=20
performance characteristics of various approaches in Web-based=20
intelligent information technology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas=20
on the development of Web-based intelligent information management=20
solutions across different domains.
The purpose of the WIMS series is to:
* Provide a forum for established researchers and practitioners to=20
present their contributions to the state of the art research and=20
development in Web technology and applications.
* Give doctoral students an opportunity to present their research to a=20
friendly and knowledgeable audience and receive valuable feedback.
* Provide an informal social event where Web technology researchers and=20
practitioners can meet.
WIMS traditionally hosts a small number of short tutorials on the topics =

related to the scope of the conference series. The role of a WIMS=20
tutorial is to be a theme-oriented comprehensive survey. The call for=20
WIMS 2016 tutorials will be published separately.
WIMS also offers its infrastructure and facilities for the organizers of =

satellite workshops that complement the scope of the conference. The=20
call for WIMS 2016 workshops will also be published separately.
Companies or individuals interested in presenting their industrial=20
products or methodologies are invited to contact the conference chairs.

                  state of the art research and development in Web
                  technology and applications.<br>
                  * Give doctoral students an opportunity to present
                  their research to a friendly and knowledgeable
                  audience and receive valuable feedback.<br>
                  * Provide an informal social event where Web
                  technology researchers and practitioners can meet.<br>
                  WIMS traditionally hosts a small number of short
                  tutorials on the topics related to the scope of the
                  conference series. The role of a WIMS tutorial is to
                  be a theme-oriented comprehensive survey. The call for
                  WIMS 2016 tutorials will be published separately.<br>
                  WIMS also offers its infrastructure and facilities for
                  the organizers of satellite workshops that complement
                  the scope of the conference. The call for WIMS 2016
                  workshops will also be published separately.<br>
                  Companies or individuals interested in presenting
                  their industrial products or methodologies are invited
                  to contact the conference chairs.<br>

                  Four types of submissions are solicited for the main
                  conference:<br>
                  i. Regular research papers;<br>
                  ii. Short research papers;<br>
                  iii. Case Studies and Applications papers;<br>
                  iv. Posters<br>
                  The papers in all the categories should describe
                  original results that have not been accepted or
                  submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions
                  will be evaluated by at least three members of the
                  international program committee.<br>
                  <br>
                  Regular Research Papers<br>

=3D=3D<br>
                  The papers in this category are the reports on
                  accomplished research work or in-depth discussions and
                  analysis of a certain problem. The first type of
                  papers can present a novel method, technique or
                  analysis with appropriate empirical or other type of
                  evaluation as a proof of validity. The main evaluation
                  criteria for this category are originality, technical
                  soundness, and the soundness of evaluation. For the
                  second type within the genre we expect receiving
                  reasonable overviews placing a problem onto the
                  state-of-the-art landscape and analyzing how far
                  current solutions fall short. We also expect in-depth
                  discussions and analysis of a certain problem, with
                  clear definitions and argumentation in terms of
                  qualitative or quantitative representation of the main
                  characteristics of the problem.<br>

<br>
                  The papers in this category are the short reports of
                  the preliminary results or describing the work in
                  progress. The main evaluation criteria for this
                  category are originality, technical correctness, and
                  possible value of the planned results in a short to
                  mid-term perspective.<br>
                  Short papers can be also presented in a form of a
                  poster.<br>

                  Case Studies and Applications Papers<br>
                  The papers in this category describe case studies of
                  deployed applications, lessons learnt, and examples of
                  measurable benefits. This category also includes
                  papers that reports innovative applications of WIMS in
                  areas of industry and government, as well as
                  industrial experience and demonstrations of innovative

                  WIMS poster track is a venue for late-breaking
                  results, ongoing research activities, and speculative
                  or innovative work in progress. This track is intended
                  to provide authors and participants with the ability
                  to connect with each other and to engage in
                  discussions about the work. Posters provide authors
                  with a unique opportunity to draw attention to their
                  work during the conference.<br>
