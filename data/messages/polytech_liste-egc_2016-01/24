The 6th International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) will 
be held from 21 to 23 September 2016 in Almer√≠a, Spain. Previous MEDI 
events took place at Obidos/Portugal (2011), Poitiers/France (2012), 
Calabria/Italy (2013), Larnaca/Cyrpus (2014) and Rhodes Island/ Greece 
(2015). The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for 
the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the 
interaction and collaboration between the models and data research 
communities. This international scientific event, initiated by 
researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting 
the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and 
faculty/student exchanges.

commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be 
carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical 
soundness, and clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be 
published in Springer LNCS series. Duplicate submissions are not allowed.



*Gala party will take place 22 September in Fort-Bravo/Texas-Hollywood*


http://fortbravooficial.com/


/Fort-Bravo/Texas-Hollywood are the biggest film studios of Western 
style in Europe. They are located in the desert of Tabernas, Almería. 
These decorations dating from the 60´s when Sergio Leone discovered 
Tabernas (Almería) and started rolling his numerous successes in the 
cinema, making Tabernas a reference to making movies, knows as 
spaghetti-western movies. Currently in Fort Bravo is still rolling 
films, commercials, music videos, shorts films... You can contemplate an 
authentic wooden populated American Old West, see a typical Mexican 
town, enter in a military fort and see an Indian village or walking in 
the streets of the West town, watching the show of cowboys with 
gunfights and poker games in the Saloon, bank robbery, cancan dancing in 
traditional costumes of the time, ride on horse cart, rental horses for 
guided walks and routes, photo studio for dressing like the people of 
the Western era... Fort-Bravo/Texas-Hollywood has Saloon-Bar , 
restaurant, souvenir shop to get souvenir gift and bungalows fully 
equipped for use and enjoyment. And in summer Fort-Bravo/Texas-Hollywood 
has a beautiful themed swimming pool for taking a bath with your family 
and a private BBQ local or a very big Saloon of celebrations for all 
kinds of events, celebrations, parties, communions, weddings and bachelor./
