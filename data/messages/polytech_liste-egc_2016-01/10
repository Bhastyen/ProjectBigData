Subject: [liste-egc] CFP Data Quality in Big Data: Problems and Solutions

IEEE Transactions on Big Data
Special Issue Call for Papers
Data Quality in Big Data: Problems and Solutions


One-page white paper due: 15 January 2016
Full paper submissions due:  1 April 2016
Acceptance notification: 1 June 2016
Special issue publication: September 2016


The recent emergence of Big Data ushered in many applications that are 
vast and varied. Though data quality problems existed before, the 
advent of Big Data adds new dimensions as well as exacerbates data 
quality problems. We seek submissions for the September 2016 special 
issue on Data Quality in Big Data: Problems and Solutions.

The guest editors solicit papers covering all areas of data quality 
issues in the context of Big Data including data acquisition, data 
cleaning, semantics and meta data generation, transformations and 
multi-modal data fusion, data modeling and storage, query execution 
and workflow optimization, and analytics. Suggested topics include, 
but are not limited to, the following in Big Data context:


Data sampling, aggregation, and anomaly detection.

Data acquisition, cleaning, semantics and meta data generation in 
application domains such as Bioinformatics, Helathcare, Smart cities, 
Smart grid, and Internet of Things (IoT).

Fully automated approaches to streaming data error detection and 
correction.

Data transformations and multi-modal data fusion.

Big Data quality frameworks and standards.

Big Data quality metrics.

Data quality assessment, enforcement, and management.

Declarative data constraints specification and enforcement.


The guest editors for this special issue are Venkat Gudivada 
(gudivadav15@ecu.edu), East Carolina University; Vijay Raghavan 
(vijay@cacs.louisiana.edu), University of Louisiana; and  Laure 
Berti-Equille (lberti@qf.org.qa), Senior Scientist, Qatar Computing 
Research Institute, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar.

Interested authors should send a one-page white paper to the guest 
editors by 15 January 2016 via email. Full paper submissions are due 
by 1 April 2016. For author guidelines and information on how to 
submit a manuscript electronically, visit
