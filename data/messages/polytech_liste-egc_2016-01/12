MultiLingMine 2016: 1st International Workshop on Modeling, Learning and 
Mining for Cross/Multilinguality

MOTIVATIONS
====================
In the last few years the phenomenon of multilingual information 
overload has received significant attention due to the huge availability 
of information coded in many different languages. Recent statistics 
(http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/#byregion) have 
reported that non-English contents represent more than half of the 
information available on the Internet. We have in fact witnessed a 
growing popularity of tools that are designed for collaboratively 
editing through contributors across the world, which has led to an 
increased demand for methods capable of effectively and efficiently 
searching, retrieving, managing and mining different language-written 
document collections. The multilingual information overload phenomenon 
introduces new challenges to modern information retrieval systems. By 
better searching, indexing, and organizing such rich and heterogeneous 
information, we can discover and exchange knowledge at a larger 
world-wide scale.
However, since research on multilingual information is relatively young, 
important issues still remain, including:

* how to define a translation-independent representation of the 
documents across many languages;
* whether existing solutions for comparable corpora can be enhanced to 
generalize to multiple languages without depending on bilingual 
dictionaries or incurring bias in merging language-specific results;
* how to profitably exploit knowledge bases to enable 
translation-independent preserving and unveiling of content semantics;
* how to define proper indexing structures and multidimensional data 
structures to better capture the multi-topic and/or multi-aspect nature 
of the documents in a multilingual context;
* how to detect duplicate or redundant information among different 
languages or, conversely, novelty in the produced information;
* how to enrich and update multi-lingual knowledge bases from documents;
* how to exploit multi-lingual knowledge bases for question answering;
* how to extend topic modeling to deal with multi/cross-lingual 
documents;
* how to evaluate and visualize retrieval and mining results.


AIMS AND SCOPE
================================================================

The aim of this workshop, to be held in conjunction with the 2016 ECIR 
Conference, is to establish a venue to discuss research advances in 
cross-/multilingual related topics.
A major objective of this workshop is to focus on research questions 
that have not been deeply investigated so far. In particular, we solicit 
contributions that aim to consider the following aspects:

* Modeling: methods to develop suitable representations for multilingual 
corpora, possibly embedding information from different views/aspects, 
such as, e.g., tensor models and decompositions, word-to-vector models, 
statistical topic models, representational learning, etc.
* Learning: any unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised approach 
in cross/multilingual contexts.
* The use of knowledge bases to support the modeling, learning, or both 
stages of multilingual corpora analysis.
* Emerging trends and applications, such as, e.g., cross-view 
cross-/multilingual IR, multilingual text mining in social networks, 
etc.

The workshop will increase the visibility of the above research themes, 
and will also bridge closely related research fields such as information 
access, searching and ranking, information extraction, feature 
engineering, text mining.

The workshop is mainly geared towards students, researchers and 
practitioners actively working on topics related to information 
retrieval, classification, clustering, indexing and modeling of 
multilingual corpora collections. As a (soft) prerequisite, the audience 
should be knowledgeable about basics on information retrieval and data 
mining.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
======================

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Multilingual/cross-lingual information access, web search, and ranking
* Multilingual/cross-lingual relevance feedback
* Multilingual/cross-lingual text summarization
* Multilingual/cross-lingual question answering
* Multilingual/cross-lingual relation extraction
* Multilingual/cross-lingual information extraction
* Multilingual/cross-lingual document indexing
* Multilingual/cross-lingual topic modeling
* Multi-view/Multimodal representation models for multilingual corpora 
and cross-lingual applications
* Cross-view multi/cross-lingual information retrieval and document 
mining
* Multilingual/cross-lingual classification and clustering
* Probabilistic models for learning from multilingual corpora
* Knowledge-based approaches to model and mine multilingual corpora
* Social network analysis and mining for 
multilinguality/cross-linguality
* Plagiarism detection for multilinguality/cross-linguality
* Sentiment analysis for multilinguality/cross-linguality
* Deep learning for multilinguality/cross-linguality
* Novel validity criteria for cross-/multilingual retrieval and learning 
tasks
* Novel paradigms for visualization of patterns mined in multilingual 
corpora
* Emerging applications for multilingual/cross-lingual domains


IMPORTANT DATES
================================================================
Submission deadline:  January 25, 2016
Acceptance notification:  February 22, 2016
Camera-ready deadline:  March 10, 2016
Workshop day:  March 20, 2016


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================
MultiLingMine 2016 solicits original research papers, including 
theoretical contributions, evaluation results, case studies, works in 
progress.

All submissions must be written in English following Springer LNCS 
author guidelines and should be submitted as PDF files to EasyChair, 
with maximum paper length of 10 pages. Papers can be accepted as either 
Short (6 pages) or Full (10 pages) contribution.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. Please be 
aware of the fact that at least one author per paper is required to 
register for and attend the workshop to present the work. In case of 
no-show, the paper (even if accepted) will be deleted from the 
proceedings and from the program.

Submission site:  
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=multilingmine2016.


PROCEEDINGS PUBLICATION AND SPECIAL ISSUE ON JOURNAL
================================================================
Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop 
proceedings publication service (http://ceur-ws.org/), which assures 
that the published papers are permanently available and citable.

Extended versions of a selection of accepted papers will be invited for 
submission to a special issue of a premier journal in the fields of 
interest of the workshop (e.g., Information Processing & Management, 
Journal of Natural Language Engineering  (JNLE), Data & Knowledge 
Engineering).
