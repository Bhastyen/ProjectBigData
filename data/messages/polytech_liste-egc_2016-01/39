Paper Submission: February 15, 2016
Decision Notification: March 28, 2016
Camera-Ready Submission: April 11, 2016
---------------

The proliferation of online services and applications facilitated
considerably our lives. Nowadays we can easily communicate and share =
data
with other users using these services. On-line services are also a =
building
corner of ICT application such as e-commerce, e-government and e-health
applications that facilitate many administrative and personal tasks.
However, several emerging issues and challenges have to be considered =
while
setting up these future Internet services and applications. In =
particular,
we explore three different key aspects of future Internet services and
applications:

=E2=80=A2 Modeling, Provisioning and Management
=E2=80=A2 Data Protection
=E2=80=A2 Data Collection, Storage and Analysis

The goal of this track is to offer academic and industrial researchers =
and
practitioners a platform for discussions related to these aspects of =
future
Internet services and applications.

TOPICS
We target contributions from both academia and industrials on the =
following
topics, but not limited to:
- Modeling, Provisioning and Management
  =E2=80=A2 Collaborative technologies for QoS Management of SOA and =
Cloud
    architectures
  =E2=80=A2 Service Virtualization for SOA
  =E2=80=A2 Collaborative Management of Virtualized Cloud Resources
  =E2=80=A2 Monitoring of Cloud Services
  =E2=80=A2 Reconfiguration and recovery of Cloud Services
  =E2=80=A2 Modeling and Specification of collaborative Cloud services
  =E2=80=A2 Service Level Agreement (SLA) Negotiation, Automation and =
Orchestration
    for Cloud Computing
  =E2=80=A2 Cloud Federation
  =E2=80=A2 Availability and Reliability of Collaborative Cloud

-Data Protection
  =E2=80=A2 Privacy and Trust for the Cloud
  =E2=80=A2 Accountability/Privacy techniques and models
  =E2=80=A2 Accountability/Privacy of Web and cloud services
  =E2=80=A2 Accountability/Privacy policy description frameworks
  =E2=80=A2 Accountability/Privacy aware software design, development =
and composition
  =E2=80=A2 Auditing of cloud services
  =E2=80=A2 Accountability evidences
  =E2=80=A2 Tools and frameworks for accountability

- Data Collection, Storage and Analysis
  =E2=80=A2 Elastic databases and storage services
  =E2=80=A2 Elastic data filtering systems
  =E2=80=A2 Large scale data analysis techniques and algorithms
  =E2=80=A2 Anonymity preserving data analysis techniques and algorithms
