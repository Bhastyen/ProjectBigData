WIMS is a series of peer-reviewed International Computer Science conferen=
ces. It is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present their sta=
te-of-the-art results in building Intelligent Web, to examine performance=
 characteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent informati=
on technology, and to cross-fertilize their ideas on the development of W=
eb-based intelligent information management solutions across different do=

Submission Guidelines
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Four types of submissions are solicited for the main conference:
i. Regular research papers;
ii. Short research papers;
iii. Case Studies and Applications papers;
iv. Posters
The papers in all the categories should describe original results that ha=
ve not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissi=
ons will be evaluated by at least three members of the international prog=
ram committee.

Regular Research Papers
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The papers in this category are the reports on accomplished research work=
 or in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain problem. The first typ=
e of papers can present a novel method, technique or analysis with approp=
riate empirical or other type of evaluation as a proof of validity. The m=
ain evaluation criteria for this category are originality, technical soun=
dness, and the soundness of evaluation. For the second type within the ge=
nre we expect receiving reasonable overviews placing a problem onto the s=
tate-of-the-art landscape and analyzing how far current solutions fall sh=
ort. We also expect in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain proble=
m, with clear definitions and argumentation in terms of qualitative or qu=
antitative representation of the main characteristics of the problem.
Page limit: 12 ACM pages
Short Research Papers
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The papers in this category are the short reports of the preliminary resu=
lts or describing the work in progress. The main evaluation criteria for =
this category are originality, technical correctness, and possible value =
of the planned results in a short to mid-term perspective.
Short papers can be also presented in a form of a poster.
Page limit: 6 ACM pages
Case Studies and Applications Papers
The papers in this category describe case studies of deployed application=
s, lessons learnt, and examples of measurable benefits. This category als=
o includes papers that reports innovative applications of WIMS in areas o=
f industry and government, as well as industrial experience and demonstra=
tions of innovative systems.
Page limit: 12 ACM pages
Posters
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
WIMS poster track is a venue for late-breaking results, ongoing research =
activities, and speculative or innovative work in progress. This track is=
 intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to connect=
 with each other and to engage in discussions about the work. Posters pro=
vide authors with a unique opportunity to draw attention to their work du=
ring the conference.
Page limit: 4 ACM pages
Submissions should be made electronically in PDF or DOC/DOCX (MS/Open Wor=
d) format via the electronic submission system of the WIMS2016 Conference=
 Management system at:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwims16
Publication
Accepted papers/tutorials/posters will be published by ACM and disseminat=
ed through the ACM Digital Library through the International Conference P=
roceedings Series (ICPS).
Authors selected best papers from the conference will be invited to submi=
t an expanded version for publication in an rank A international journal.=

Submission Guidelines
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Four types of submissions are solicited for the main conference:
i. Regular research papers;
ii. Short research papers;
iii. Case Studies and Applications papers;
iv. Posters
The papers in all the categories should describe original results that ha=
ve not been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissi=
ons will be evaluated by at least three members of the international prog=
ram committee.

Regular Research Papers
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The papers in this category are the reports on accomplished research work=
 or in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain problem. The first typ=
e of papers can present a novel method, technique or analysis with approp=
riate empirical or other type of evaluation as a proof of validity. The m=
ain evaluation criteria for this category are originality, technical soun=
dness, and the soundness of evaluation. For the second type within the ge=
nre we expect receiving reasonable overviews placing a problem onto the s=
tate-of-the-art landscape and analyzing how far current solutions fall sh=
ort. We also expect in-depth discussions and analysis of a certain proble=
m, with clear definitions and argumentation in terms of qualitative or qu=
antitative representation of the main characteristics of the problem.

 with each other and to engage in discussions about the work. Posters pro=
vide authors with a unique opportunity to draw attention to their work du=
