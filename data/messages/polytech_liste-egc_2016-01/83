Call for Papers:

22nd International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS 2016

Graph-based Modeling of Conceptual Structures

********************************************************************************************
5th to 7th July, 2016, Annecy, France

Conference web site:www.irit.fr/ICCS2016/

Co-located: 9th International Conference on Formal Ontology in
Information Systems (FOIS) 2016
********************************************************************************************

The International Conferences on Conceptual Structures (ICCS) focus on
the formal analysis and representation of conceptual knowledge with
applications to artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and
related areas of computer science. The ICCS conferences evolved from a
series of seven annual workshops on conceptual graphs, starting with an
informal gathering hosted by John F. Sowa in 1986. Recently, graph-based
knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigms are getting more
and more attention. The aim of the ICCS 2016 conference is to build upon
its long standing expertise in graph-based KRR and focus on providing
modelling, formal and application results of graph-based systems.

ICCS 2016 will be co-located with FOIS 2016, held in Annecy, in the
Polytech building at the campus of the University of Savoie.

The conference welcomes contributions that address graph-based
representation and reasoning paradigms (e.g. Bayesian Networks (BNs),
Semantic Networks (SNs), RDF(S), Conceptual Graphs (CGs), Formal Concept
Analysis (FCA), CP-Nets, GAI-Nets, Graph Databases, Diagrams, etc.) from
a modelling, theoretical and application viewpoint:

- Modelling results will investigate concrete real world needs for
graph-based representation, how certain use cases are of interest to the
graph community, how using graphs can bring added (business) value, what
kind of graph representation is needed for a given case, etc.

- Technical results will include fundamental graph theory based results
for novel structures for representation, extensions of existing
structures for added expressivity, conciseness, optimisation algorithms
for reasoning, reasoning explanation, etc.

- Papers reporting on application experience will be expected to
demonstrate the benefits of the graph-based proposed solutions in the
context of the use case studied with respect to other possible solutions.

The main research topics are:

- Knowledge Management,
- Knowledge Architectures,
- Reasoning under Inconsistency,
- Knowledge Representation and Uncertainty,
- Contextual Logic,
- Constraint Satisfaction,
- Decision Making,
- Argumentation,
- Ontologies,
- Semantic Web,
- Web of Data,
- Web 2.0,
- Conceptual Knowledge Acquisition,
- Data Mining,
- Text Mining,
- Natural Language Processing,
- Linguistics,
- Metaphoric, Cultural or Semiotic Considerations,
- Resource Allocation and Agreement Technologies.

Submission Information

We invite scientific papers of up to fourteen pages and posters of up to
three pages.

For each paper, an abstract must be submitted by January 28, 2016, with
full papers being due on February 4, 2016. Posters do not require
advanced abstract submission and should be submitted by March 24, 2016.

Papers and posters must be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS style
guidelines and not exceed the page limit. The submission is to be done
via EasyChair:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs20161

All paper submissions will be refereed and authors will have the
opportunity to respond to reviewers’ comments during the rebuttal phase.
Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings,
published by Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series.

Poster submissions will also be refereed but will not be included in the
conference proceedings.

At least one author of each accepted paper or poster must register for
the conference and present the paper or poster there.

Proceedings will be submitted for indexation by DBLP.
