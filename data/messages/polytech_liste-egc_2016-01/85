*Abstract*:


   Towards the end of the 1990's, data engineering community has noticed 
the bene ts
and opportunities that could be obtained by integrating Data Warehousing 
(DW) and
Data Mining (DM). Therefore, many researches proposed to integrate DM 
and DW to
solve multiple emerging problems, such as cube compression and 
association rules mining.
As a result of the success of integrating both elds, many researches 
gave raise to
several debates on the usefulness of standardising the development of 
Cube Mining (CM)
solutions. Most of them argue that standardisation e orts would make the 
systematic
development of CM solutions more feasible, and improve the 
interoperability among
multiple CM systems. In spite of this, to the best of our knowledge, 
these researches
are limited to the theoretical aspects of the subject, and do not 
propose any materialised
solution.
This is mainly due to the particular structural characteristics of data 
cubes, which are
known to be multidimensional, massive, high-dimensional and sparse. 
Without exception,
each of these characteristics represents a bottleneck for most of DM 
techniques, which
are heavily sensitive to data quality, even within the classical context 
of bi-dimensional
data [Maedche et al., 2000, Brown and Kros, 2003]. This makes every 
single attempt
to extend a particular DM to a CM technique face up to very unique 
feasibility and
scalability challenges. Subsequently, this makes the development of a 
generalised solution
to extend of a wide range of DM to CM technique an even more challenging 
task.
This thesis investigates the bene ts and the opportunities that could be 
gained
over standardising integration of DW and DM. It tackles this research 
subject that
has surprisingly seen limited research in this broad and rapidly 
developing eld, while
providing e cient and e ective solutions for its emergent challenges.
The contributions made in this thesis are made around, but not limited 
to, an
innovative framework that goes beyond the simple integration of a 
particular DM
technique in data warehouses environment, by providing the theoretical 
foundation and
technical solutions to extend a wide range of DM to CM techniques. It is 
the Modular
Open-architecture Framework for Extended Integration of Data warehousing 
and Data
mining (MOFEIDD).
The thesis demonstrates the utility and the feasibility of the MOFEIDD 
by introducing
two innovative CM proposals. The rst one is the Measures Prediction 
Module (MPM),
which is based on Neural Networks (NN)s measure prediction module. As 
for the
second proposal, it is the Sparsity Extraction Module (SEM), which is a 
based on
Association Rule (AR) module, which aims to assist CM techniques in 
confronting data
cube sparsity. A comprehensive set of experimental studies have been 
conducted to
evaluate the individual outcomes of each the proposed CM technique, and 
to assess their
combined contributions by involving them in a set of extended CM analyses.

Keywords: Data Warehousing, Data Mining, OLAP, Principal Components 
Analysis,
Neural Networks, Modular Neural Networks, Association Rules, Sparsity
