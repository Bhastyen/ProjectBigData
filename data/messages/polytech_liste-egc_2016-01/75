Apologies for multiple posting
-------------------------------------------


Call for Papers
===============

**13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced and Trusted
Computing (ATC 2016), July 18.21, 2016, Toulouse-France**

http://atc2016.sciencesconf.org/

Co-located with: SWC (Smart Wold Congress) 2016

Contact: atc2016@easychair.org

Important Dates
---------------
  Submission Deadline:     March 11, 2016
  Acceptance Notification: May 6, 2016
  Final Manuscript due:    May 20, 2016

Scope
-----

Nowadays, various kinds of novel computing concepts are increasingly
emerging for enhancing our real and virtual worlds towards smart
worlds as well as cyber-physical-social-thinking integrated hyper
worlds. Accordingly, computing systems are growing in capability and
complexity including hardware, software, communications, networks,
platforms, services, etc. Advanced computing (AC) aims to discover,
develop, and deploy computational and networking capabilities, and to
design and develop novel computing systems and architectures.

At the same time, computing must be trustworthy to engender confidence
that systems will remain secure and available. Trust/distrust
relationships in the Internet, Web applications and pervasive
infrastructures are key factors to enable dynamic interaction and
cooperation of various users, systems, and services. Trusted computing
(TC) aims at making computing and communication systems and services
available, predictable, accountable, controllable, assessable,
sustainable, dependable, persistent, and secure.

ATC conferences have taken a leading role in addressing these
challenges and achieving practical advanced computing systems with
truly trustworthy services. Started in 2005, the series of ATC
conferences have been held at Nagasaki (Japan), Vienna (Austria),
Three Gorges (China), Hong Kong (China), Oslo (Norway), Brisbane
(Australia), Xi'An (China), Banff (Canada), Fukuoka (Japan), Vietri
sul Mare (Italy), Bali (Indonesia) and Beijing (China). ATC 2016 will
include a highly selective program of technical papers, accompanied by
workshops, panel discussions, and keynote speeches. Established as a
premier venue in the area of advanced and trusted computing, ATC 2016
will offer a forum for researchers to exchange ideas and experiences
in the most innovative research and development in these challenging
areas and include all technical aspects related to Advanced Computing
(AC) and Trusted Computing (TC).

The ATC 2016 topics include, but are not limited to:

Track 1: Software Defined Networking Security and Trust
Track 2: Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain based Systems
Track 3: Privacy Preservation in Big Data
Track 4: Middleware for IoT
Track 5: Service Engineering for IoT
Track 6: Trust, Security and Privacy in Social Networks
Track 7: Trust Models Management and Standards
Track 8: Trustworthy authentication in Pervasive Computing
Track 9: Privacy and trust management in distributed systems

Workshops
----------

The ATC 2016 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops
associated with the conference, addressing research areas related to
the conference. Accepted workshop papers will be included in the
proceedings published by IEEE CS Press. Click the following links for
submission details/deadlines.

For workshop proposals, please refer to:

http://atc2016.sciencesconf.org/

Paper submission
-----------------

Main conference papers are limited to 8 pages (full papers), or 4
pages (short papers), following the IEEE CS format, and are to be
submitted as PDF via the ATC 2016 submission site:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atc2016


Paper publication
-----------------

Accepted conference papers will be published by IEEE CPS (IEEE-DL and
EI indexed). At least one author of each accepted paper is required to
register and present their work at the conference; otherwise the paper
will not be included in the proceedings.

Best Paper Awards will be presented to high quality papers. Selected
papers, after further extensions and revisions, will be published in
special issues of prestigious journals. More details can be found at:
