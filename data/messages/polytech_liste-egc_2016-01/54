CALL FOR PAPERS

9th International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (F=
OIS 2016)

July 6-9, 2016, University of Savoie, Annecy (France)

website:http://iaoa.org/fois2016
contact:fois2016@easychair.org

IMPORTANT DATES:

FOIS Paper Submission Deadline:		Jan 31, 2016
FOIS Notification:				Mar 31, 2016
Conference Date:				Jul 6-9, 2016

DEFINITION AND SCOPE

Formal ontology for information systems is now a research focus in such d=
iverse domains as conceptual modeling, database design, software engineer=
ing, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, the life science=
s, bioinformatics, geographic information science, knowledge engineering,=
 information retrieval, and the semantic web. Researchers in all these ar=
eas increasingly recognize the need for serious engagement with ontology =
to provide a foundation for their work, where ontology is understood as a=
 general theory of the types of entities and relations making up domains =
of enquiry.

The FOIS conference provides a meeting point for researchers from all dis=
ciplines with an interest in formal ontology. The conference encourages s=
ubmission of high quality articles on both theoretical issues and concret=
e applications. As in previous years, FOIS 2016 is intended as a nexus of=
 interdisciplinary research and communication. It is the flagship confere=
nce of the International Association for Ontology and its Applications (I=
AOA,http://iaoa.org/), which is a non-profit organization promoting inter=
disciplinary research and international collaboration at the intersection=
 of philosophical ontology, linguistics, logic, cognitive science, and co=
mputer science, as well as in the applications of ontological analysis to=
 conceptual modeling, knowledge engineering, knowledge management, inform=
ation-systems development, library and information science, scientific re=
search, and semantic technologies in general.

KEYNOTE SPEAKERS
(details inhttp://www.iaoa.org/fois2016/index.php?n=3DMain.Program)

Friederike Moltmann (IHPST, Paris, France & New York University, USA)
Stephen Mumford (University of Nottingham, UK)
Gilberto C=C3=83=C2=A2mara (National Institute for Space Research, Brazil=
)

TOPICS OF INTEREST

We seek high-quality papers on a wide range of topics. Concerning scope, =
an ideal FOIS paper will address both content-related ontological issues =
and their formal modeling, as well as their impact and relevance for some=
 aspects of information systems. Areas of particular interest to the conf=
erence include the following:

Foundational Issues
* Kinds of entities: particulars/universals, continuants/occurrents, abst=
racta/concreta, dependent entities/independent entities, natural objects/=
artifacts
* Formal relations: parthood, identity, connection, dependence, constitut=
ion, causality, subsumption, instantiation
* Vagueness and granularity
* Space, time, and change

Methodological issues
* Role of reference ontologies
* Top-level vs. domain-specific ontologies
* Relationship with cognition, language and semantics
* Formal comparison among ontologies
* Ontology integration and alignment

Domain-specific ontologies
* Ontology of physical reality (matter, space, time, motion, etc.)
* Ontology of biological reality (genes, proteins, cells, organisms, etc.=
)
* Ontology of mental reality and agency (beliefs, intentions, emotions, p=
ercepts, etc.)
* Ontology of artifacts, functions and roles
* Ontology of social reality (institutions, organizations, norms, social =
relationships, artistic expressions, languages, etc.)
* Ontology of perception (human and artificial)

Applications
* Ontology-driven information systems design
* Ontological foundations for conceptual modeling
* Knowledge management
* Qualitative modeling
* Computational linguistics
* Information retrieval
* Semantic Web, web services
* Ontology and the Internet of Things: Smart Networked Systems and Societ=
ies
* Ontology for Big Data
* Business modeling
* Ontologies for particular scientific disciplines (biology, chemistry, g=
eography, physics, cognitive sciences, linguistics etc.)
* Ontologies for engineering: shape, form and function, artifacts, manufa=
cturing, design, architecture, etc.
* Ontologies for the humanities: arts, cultural studies, history, law, li=
terature, philosophy, etc.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Submitted papers must not exceed 14 pages (including the bibliography) an=
d include an abstract of no more than 300 words. Papers should be submitt=

OS Press, this year in electronic format with permanent open access (!).
