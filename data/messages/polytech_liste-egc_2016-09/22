The user modeling and learning analytics group (LORIA Lab.) at the =
Universit=E9 de Lorraine, France offer a fully-funded 3 year PhD =
position on:

=AB Educational barometer for students: from learning process =
improvement to system adoption =BB =20

Starting date: January 2017

DESCRIPTION:

Context:
The general context of this PhD thesis is e-Learning. The applicative =
aim is the improvement of the quality of the learning process of =
students. We propose to reach this goal through the design and the =
development of an educational barometer, in the same line as activity =
indicators used in Sports or Health.
Such an educational barometer is dedicated to students. Through this =
barometer, each student can know his/her position within the class and =
can be provided with recommendations to increase his/her motivation and =
improve his/her position.
=20
Scientific challenges:
The scientific challenges for the design of this barometer are manifold:
- managing data heterogeneity: the design of student models, relying on =
multi-source data: their traces of activity on various digital devices, =
information about them provided by their educational institution: =
demographic, grades, teacher comments, etc. Such models will be used by =
the following challenge.
- managing student satisfaction/motivation: the design of a recommender =
system dedicated to students, that recommends pedagogical resources, =
with the aim to improve both motivation and students knowledge. =
Resources can be exercises, lectures, or even peers. The recommender =
system relies on student and resource models.
- managing recommendation explanations: the design of an =93explanation=94=
 plug-in, that aims at explaining/justifying why a recommendation has =
been proposed to a given student. This plug-in aims at improving the =
confidence of students in the barometer and their adoption of this =
plug-in.
=20
Skills and requirements:
Strong interactions with classes of students, teachers and parents, as =
well as with researchers in Education or cognitive psychology and =
ergonoms will be of the highest importance to ensure the success of this =
barometer.
Each model, system and plug-in designed will be developed to validated =
experimentally. So, skills in programming (Java is preferred) will be =
appreciated.
