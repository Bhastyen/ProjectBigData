Subject: [liste-egc] Call for papers DOLAP 2017 @ EDBT/ICDT

DOLAP 2017
19th International Workshop On Design, Optimization, Languages and 
Analytical Processing of Big Data
(Colocated with EDBT/ICDT 2017)
http://www.info.univ-tours.fr/~marcel/dolap2017


Data Warehouse (DW) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) technologies 
are the core of current Decision Support Systems. The widespread 
deployment of both DWs and OLAP technologies is due to the intuitive 
representation of data and simple primitives provided to data analysts 
or managers in support of management decisions. Research in data 
warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, 
management and use of information systems for decision support.

BI of the future will be significantly different than what the current 
state-of-the-practice supports. The trend is to move from the current 
decision support systems that are “data presenting” to more dynamic 
systems that allow the semi-automation of the decision making process. 
This means that the systems partially guide their users towards data 
discovery, intuition and system-aided decision making via intelligent 
techniques and visualization. In the back stage, the thrust of the big 
data era, with the requires that new methods, models, techniques, or 
architecture are needed to cope with the increasing demand in capacity, 
data type diversity and responsiveness. And of course, this does not 
necessarily mean to re-invent the wheel, but rather, as recommended by 
Gartner to companies regarding BD adoption, “Build on existing BI 
programs – don’t abandon or segregate them”.  We envision DOLAP 2017 as 
a venue where novel ideas around these new landscapes of business 
intelligence and big data are fostered and nurtured and new exiting 
results are produced, in an attempt to build a strong, vibrant community 
around these areas.

Eighteen DOLAP workshops have been held in the past with great success. 
During these years, DOLAP has been established as one of the reference 
places for researchers to publish their work in the area of data 
warehousing and OLAP and maintains a high quality of accepted papers. 
Like the previous DOLAP workshops, DOLAP 2017 aims at synergistically 
connecting the research community and industry practitioners and 
provides an international forum where both researchers and practitioners 
can share their findings in theoretical foundations, current 
methodologies, and practical experiences, and where industry technology 
developers can describe technical details about their products and 
companies exploiting BI and Big Data technology can discuss case studies 
and experiences.


DOLAP accepts short and long paper submissions. The page limit is 10 
pages for full papers and 5 pages for short papers (in ACM format). Each 
submission will be reviewed by 3 members of the program committee. The 
best papers presented at DOLAP will be invited to a reputed 
international journal, as it has been the case for most of the past 
editions.

Long papers include novel, unpublished and mature research, industrial 
or survey work. Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might 
be accepted to the workshop as short papers. Short papers include:
* On-going: novel research works with preliminary results.
* Vision: position papers outlining research issues for future work.
* PhD: single-authored submissions from PhD students at the early stages 
of their PhD studies, describing the problem focused on, its importance, 
why existing solutions are not sufficient, and outlining of the novel 
contribution envisioned.
* Demonstrations: they will enjoy a presentation in the main sessions, 
not as a separate "interactive" session. The authors will be asked to 
prepare a recorded video that shows the system functionality and a few 
slides to present main features, architecture and research behind.


Research topics include, but are not limited to:

Design and Language
* Data warehousing fundamentals: architectures, modeling, design, data 
extraction, cleaning, and loading (ETL), multidimensional modeling and 
queries, maintenance, evolution, security, personalization and privacy 
in data warehouses, etc.,
* Warehousing and Variety: unstructured data (e.g., text), 
semi-structured data (e.g., XML), multimedia, spatial, temporal, and 
spatio-temporal data warehouses, stream and sensor data, semantic Web & 
Deep Web in Data warehouses, Data lakes, etc.

Optimization
* Coping with Volume: physical organization of data warehouses, 
performance optimization and tuning, scalability of DW, MapReduce in 
Data warehouses, etc.,
* Coping with Velocity: DW deployment on Parallel machine, Database 
Clusters, Cloud, smart Grid, etc., Active/Real-Time analytics & data 
warehouses, real-time queries, etc.

Analytical Processing and applications
* Analytics and Value: OLAP Exploration through visualization, 
recommendation, reformulation, approximate query-answering, 
personalization, result presentation, data storytelling, advanced 
visualization for business contexts, etc.,
* Analytics and Veracity: quality aspects of OLAP analysis, of 
exploration outcome and end-user experience, fairness of data analysis, 
analytics and data driven decision making for the data enthusiasts, etc.,
* Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, 
information retrieval, search engines, etc.
* Big Data applications: smart city, smart health, etc.


Important dates
* Workshop paper submission deadline: November 14, 2016
* Workshop paper notification: December 20, 2016
* Workshop paper camera-ready: January 15, 2017
* Workshop: March 21, 2017


Submission Instructions
Authors from universities or industry developing database systems 
technology or big data solutions can submit short (vision, PhD, demos 
and preliminary work) or long (novel work, research, industrial, survey 
papers) papers. The papers can describe novel research, the architecture 
of a commercial system or solution, the results of case studies and 
experience, or on-going work on a challenging and emerging area. They 
will be reviewed by the program committee for their technical merit, 
originality, significance, readability and relevance to the workshop. 
Duplicate submissions or already published work are not accepted.

Manuscripts should follow the formatting instructions of EDBT. They 
should be formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates (both for MS 
word and Latex) available at 
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates. There are 
two styles on the website. Both the Strict Adherence to SIGS and the 
Tighter Alternate style are allowed. Long papers cannot exceed 10 pages 
in length and short papers cannot exceed 5 pages in length. Excessively 
short submissions (3 pages or less) will not be penalized. Papers should 
be submitted in PDF format via Easychair 
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dolap2017).



Camera-Ready Instructions and Proceedings
The camera ready version of accepted papers must have a maximum length 
of 10 pages for full papers and 5 pages for short papers in double 
column. Different from previous editions, the workshop proceedings this 
year will NOT be included in the ACM Digital Library. The proceedings of 
the workshop will be published online as a volume of the CEUR Workshop 
Proceedings (http://www.ceur-ws.org), a well-known website for 
publishing workshop proceedings. It is indexed by the major publication 
portals, such as Citeseer, DBLP and Google Scholar.
