BigCVEn 2016

3rd International Workshop on BIG data meets CLOUD and Virtualized 
Environment


Collocated with:

SITIS 2016 - The 12th International Conference on SIGNAL IMAGE 
TECHNOLOGY & INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS
November 28 - December 1, 2016 - Naples, Italy

Scope of the Workshop
During the last decade, the progress of Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICT) exponentially increased the quantity of information 
available. The resulting data is often called Big Data, being 
characterized by its important volume, high velocity and variety. 
Related issues concern the problem of managing, integrating, querying 
and visualizing such massive and heterogeneous data. Specific techniques 
and methods have been developed by the international community. 
Virtualized environments and their related applications have been 
identified as suitable for processing and managing such data. Still, 
other issues have been identified and several trends are emerging to 
address those issues.
On the one hand, cloud computing provides a powerful model to connect 
users to information resources from anywhere in the world. It has become 
a significant technology with several advantages including cost savings, 
access to greater computing resources, high availability, and scalability.
On the other hand, the advent of Semantic Web has raised new 
opportunities and challenges. In this context, Big Data and Linked Data 
are being an integral part of the web infrastructure, where massive 
amounts of connected or possibly interconnectable data, addressable via 
URIs/IRIs, are available. These technologies are paving the way of the 
Web of Data. Moreover, ontology-based systems have been recognized as 
interesting and promising in what concerns data interoperability, mainly 
because they handle formal representations of data over which one may 
perform reasoning. Given the underlying heterogeneity and complexity of 
Big Data, several research issues have been identified in domains such 
as: Enterprise Information Systems' Interoperability, Building 
Information Modeling (BIM), Bioinformatics, E-Health, E-Government.
The aim of the BigCVEn Workshop is to provide a forum to bring together 
scientists, researchers and practitioners interested in these emerging 
architectures and methodologies for capturing, storing, managing and 
analyzing massive, dispersed, interconnected data over the Web. It also 
aims to discuss the connection and\or interaction between Web of 
Data/Linked Data and Big Data/Cloud Computing.

Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

• Cloud computing/Mobile Cloud
Cloud Computing standards and technologies

Important dates
Submission deadline: September 24, 2016 (extended deadline)
Acceptance/Reject notification: October 7, 2016
Camera-ready:  October 20, 2016
Author Registration:  October 20, 2016

Submission
Each submission should be at most 8 pages in total including 
bibliography and well-marked appendices, and must follow the IEEE double 
columns publication format available at:
·         Microsoft Word DOC
·         LaTex Formatting Macros

Paper submission will only be online via: Easy Chair.

Only pdf files will be accepted. Submissions not meeting these 
guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
All submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, 
significance, technical soundness, and clarity of expression by at least 
two reviewers. The organizers will examine the reviews and make final 
paper selections.

Publication
All the papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the 
conference proceedings. The proceedings will be published by IEEE 
Computer Society and referenced in IEEE Xplore Digital Library and major 
indexes. They will be available at the conference.

Registration
At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the 
workshop. Workshop registration fee is determined by SITIS. A single 
registration for the workshop or the conference allows attending both 
events.
