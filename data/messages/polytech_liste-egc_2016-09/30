*1.    Overview*

The Second IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing 
(IEEE CBDCom) is a premier forum for researchers and practitioners to 
explore and exchange experiences, ideas, techniques and tools of cloud 
computing and big data. The conference covers academic research, 
industrial applications, and also demonstration of research and 
applications. The goals of the conference include new advances, 
directions and experiences in approaches, algorithms and applications to 
storing, managing, analyzing big data; virtualization, networking, 
scheduling and quality of service (QoS), and issues and challenges for 
cloud computing; implementations on different computing platforms for 
cloud and big data systems, and experiences of solving real-world 
problems are especially welcome.

The IEEE CBDCom 2016 topics include but are not limited to the 
following. Authors are encouraged to submit unpublished original 
research works in one of the following topics.

*2.    Scope and Topics
*

Big Data Algorithms, Applications and Services Big Data Mining and 
Analytics Big Data Processing and Querying Cloud and Big Data for 
Internet of Things (IoT) Government and Industrial Experiences for Cloud 
and Big Data Green Computing and Networking Technologies for Cloud and 
Big Data Software Engineering for Cloud Computing and Big Data Cloud 
Computing Solutions and Platforms Privacy and Security for Cloud and Big 
Data Big Data Visualization Big Data Education Virtualization 
Technologies, Cloud Data Management and Storage, Cloud Resource 
Management and QoS.

*3.    Important Dates (Tentative)*

**
−    December 12, 2016,  Full article submission
−    March 13, 2017, First round notification (minor/major revision)
−    May 8, 2017, Final acceptance notification
−    June 12, 2017,  Camera-ready

*4.    Submission*
  There are two types of submissions to this special issue:

 1. The first category includes the best papers relevant to the above
    topics selected from The IEEE International Conference on Cloud and
    Big Data Computing (CBDCOM’2016) that hold in Toulouse, France 18-21
    July, 2016.  Authors of selected papers are invited to submit an
    extended version with at least 30% difference in technical content.
 2. In the second category, we solicit papers from the research
    community with an open call for papers. Every submission must be of
    high quality and original, not published or currently submitted
    elsewhere. Every submission will also be evaluated by at least three
    independent reviewers, using the same review process and standard
    for the Journal of Concurrency and Computation: practice and
    experience regular submissions.

Best Regards.
Ladjel.
