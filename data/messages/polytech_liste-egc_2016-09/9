        SITIS 2016 - The 12th International Conference on SIGNAL IMAGE
        TECHNOLOGY &amp; INTERNET BASED SYSTEMS<br>
        November 28 - December 1, 2016 - Naples, Italy<br>
        <br>
        <b>Scope of the Workshop</b><br>
        During the last decade, the progress of Information and
        Communication Technologies (ICT) exponentially increased the
        quantity of information available. The resulting data is often
        called Big Data, being characterized by its important volume,
        high velocity and variety. Related issues concern the problem of
        managing, integrating, querying and visualizing such massive and
        heterogeneous data. Specific techniques and methods have been
        developed by the international community. Virtualized
        environments and their related applications have been identified
        as suitable for processing and managing such data. Still, other
        issues have been identified and several trends are emerging to
        address those issues. <br>
        On the one hand, cloud computing provides a powerful model to
        connect users to information resources from anywhere in the
        world. It has become a significant technology with several
        advantages including cost savings, access to greater computing
        resources, high availability, and scalability. <br>
        On the other hand, the advent of Semantic Web has raised new
        opportunities and challenges. In this context, Big Data and
        Linked Data are being an integral part of the web
        infrastructure, where massive amounts of connected or possibly
        interconnectable data, addressable via URIs/IRIs, are available.
        These technologies are paving the way of the Web of Data.
        Moreover, ontology-based systems have been recognized as
        interesting and promising in what concerns data
        interoperability, mainly because they handle formal
        representations of data over which one may perform reasoning.
        Given the underlying heterogeneity and complexity of Big Data,
        several research issues have been identified in domains such as:
        Enterprise Information Systems' Interoperability, Building
        Information Modeling (BIM), Bioinformatics, E-Health,
        E-Government. <br>
        The aim of the BigCVEn Workshop is to provide a forum to bring
        together scientists, researchers and practitioners interested in
        these emerging architectures and methodologies for capturing,
        storing, managing and analyzing massive, dispersed,
        interconnected data over the Web. It also aims to discuss the
        connection and\or interaction between Web of Data/Linked Data
        and Big Data/Cloud Computing.<br>
        <br>
        Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:<br>
        <br>
