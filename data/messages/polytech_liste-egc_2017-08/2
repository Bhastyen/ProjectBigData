=3D=3D Call for Papers =3D=3D

You are invited to participate in the upcoming Second Workshop on Mining
Scientific Papers: Computational Linguistics and Bibliometrics
(CLBib-2017), to be held as part of the 16th International Society of
Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference (ISSI-2017, October 16-20,
Wuhan, China, http://www.issi2017.org/).

The call for papers is available at: https://easychair.org/cfp/CLBib2017


=3D=3D=3D Important Dates =3D=3D=3D

- Abstract registration deadline: September 3, 2017
- Submission deadline: September 10, 2017
- Notification of acceptance: September 30, 2017
- Camera-ready papers: October 6, 2017
- Workshop: October 16-20, 2017 (exact date to be confirmed), Wuhan, China


=3D=3D=3D Scope and Aim of the Workshop =3D=3D=3D

The open access movement in scientific publishing and search engines like
Google Scholar have made scientific articles more broadly accessible.
During the last decade, the availability of scientific papers in full text
has become more and more widespread thanks to the growing number of
publications on online platforms such as ArXiv and CiteSeer. The efforts to
provide articles in machine-readable formats and the rise of Open Access
publishing have resulted in a number of standardized formats for scientific
papers (such as NLM-JATS, TEI, DocBook), full-text datasets for research
experiments (PubMed, JSTOR, etc.) and corpora (iSearch, etc.). At the same
time, research in the field of Natural Language Processing have provided a
number of open source tools for versatile text processing (e.g. NLTK,
Mallet, OpenNLP, CoreNLP, Gate, CiteSpace).

Scientific papers are highly structured texts and display specific
properties related to their references but also argumentative and
rhetorical structure. Recent research in this field has concentrated on the
construction of ontologies for citations and scientific articles (e.g.
CiTO, LinkedScience1) and studies of the distribution of references .
However, up to now full-text mining efforts are rarely used to provide data
for bibliometric analyses. While bibliometrics traditionally relies on the
analysis of metadata of scientific papers (see e.g. a recent special issue
on Combining Bibliometrics and Information Retrieval, Mayr & Scharnhorst,
2015), we will explore the ways full-text processing of scientific papers
and linguistic analyses can play. With this workshop we like to discuss
novel approaches and provide insights into scientific writing that can
bring new perspectives to understand both the nature of citations and the
nature of scientific articles. The possibility to enrich metadata by the
full-text processing of papers offers new fields of application to
bibliometrics studies.

Working with full text allows us to go beyond metadata used in
bibliometrics. Full text offers a new field of investigation, where the
major problems arise around the organization and structure of text, the
extraction of information and its representation on the level of metadata.
Furthermore, the study of contexts around in-text citations offers new
perspectives related to the semantic dimension of citations. The analyses
of citation contexts and the semantic categorization of publications will
allow us to rethink co-citation networks, bibliographic coupling and other
bibliometric techniques.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers in bibliometrics and
computational linguistics in order to study the ways bibliometrics can
benefit from large-scale text analytics and sense mining of scientific
papers, thus exploring the interdisciplinarity of Bibliometrics and Natural
Language Processing. How can we enhance author network analysis and
bibliometrics using data obtained by text analytics? What insights can NLP
provide on the structure of scientific writing, on citation networks, and
on in-text citation analysis?



=3D=3D=3D Goals of the workshop =3D=3D=3D

The workshop aims to bring together researchers in bibliometrics and
computational linguistics in order to study the ways bibliometrics can
benefit from large-scale text analytics and sense mining of scientific
papers, thus exploring the interdisciplinarity of Bibliometrics and Natural
Language Processing.

The first edition of this workshop, co-located with ISSI 2015, attracted
more than 70 participants and six full paper contributions, showing a large
interest in these topics in the community. The goal of this second edition
of the workshop is to continue to encourage the collaboration between these
two domains and to answer questions like: How can we enhance author network
analysis and Bibliometrics using data obtained by text analytics? What
insights can NLP provide on the structure of scientific writing, on
citation networks, and on in-text citation analysis?

=3D=3D=3D Submission Guidelines =3D=3D=3D

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another
journal or conference.

All submissions must be written in English up to 6 pages and following the
ISSI 2017 Template for full papers.

Submissions require registration as a user in the EasyChair system. Please
go to https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dclbib2017 to register.

All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers.
Please be aware of the fact that at least one author per paper needs to
register for the workshop and attend the workshop to present the work.

The accepted papers will be invited for a publication in a special issue of
the Journal Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics <
http://journal.frontiersin.org/journal/research-metrics-and-analytics>.



=3D=3D=3D Workshop Topics =3D=3D=3D

Topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Linguistic modeling and discourse analysis for scientific texts
- User interfaces, text representations and visualizations
- Structure of scientific articles (discourse / argumentative / rhetorical
/ social)
- Scientific corpora and paper standards
- Act of citations, in-text citations and Content Citation Analysis
- Co-citation and bibliographic coupling
- Text enhanced bibliographic coupling
- Terminology extraction
- Text mining and information extraction
- Scientific information retrieval
- Ontological descriptions of scientific content
- Knowledge extraction

The workshop will involve research project reports, system demonstrations
and a panel discussion on the perspectives for the development of new text
analytics approaches for bibliometrics.
