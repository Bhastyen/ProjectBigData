Thanks for sending the announcement to anyone possibly interested.


The TAO research group  (CNRS / INRIA / Univ. Paris-Sud) seeks a 
computational postdoc to characterize nutritional profiles and model the 
/causal relationships between food intake, socio-economic profile, and 
health/, based on longitudinal databases reporting the daily food 
purchases for 20,000 households over 20 years.

The successful candidate will work in a multi-disciplinary team (machine 
learning, biology, sociology) to develop new approaches for causal 
modeling and interpretation.

Candidates with expertise in machine learning, natural language 
processing, statistics, computational sociology, are encouraged to apply.

*The group*

Our research group is powered by a multidisciplinary team of researchers 
with a passion for new problems in data science, and applications with 
impact on real life. Members come from diverse backgrounds (computer 
science, maths, statistical physics, sociology, biology), sharing 
approaches (deep learning, causal modelling, continuous models) and 
interests (applications in natural sciences, engineering, sociology).

*How to apply*
Interested candidates should submit a one-page description of research 
interests and plans, a resume, and contact information for three 
references to Drs. Sebag and Schoenauer via e-mail (sebag@lri.fr, 
marc.schoenauer@inria.fr). Successful candidates will be committed to 
high impact research within a collaborative, diverse and inclusive 
research environment.

*Date*: before October 10th, 2017

*More*
Interested candidates are welcome to contact Michele Sebag and Marc 
Schoenauer for more detail.

*Position*: postdoc at INRIA, funded by University Paris-Saclay, 
Nutriperso Project.

*Location*: Lab. of Computer Science, Shannon building, Univ. Paris-Sud.
