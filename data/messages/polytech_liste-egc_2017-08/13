CLEF 2018
Avignon, France - September 10-14, 2018
**http://clef2018.clef-initiative.eu/
  *****************************


Call for Labs Proposals

*CLEF is a leading annual international conference exploring topics in 
information access technologies. CLEF uniquely combines evaluation 
laboratories and workshops with research presentations, panels, poster 
and demo sessions. CLEF 2018 (http://clef2018.clef-initiative.eu/) will 
be held on 10-14 September 2018 at Avignon University, Avignon, France.

Researchers and practitioners from all areas of information access and 
related communities are invited to submit proposals for evaluation labs 
for consideration for inclusion in CLEF 2018. Lab proposals will be 
reviewed by the lab selection committee. Organizers of selected 
proposals will be invited to include their lab in the CLEF 2018 lab 
programme, possibly subject to small suggested modifications to their 
proposal to better suit the CLEF lab workflow or timeline.

*Background*

The CLEF Initiative (http://www.clef-initiative.eu/) is a self-organized 
body whose main mission is to promote research, innovation, and 
development of information access systems with an emphasis on 
multilingual information in different modalities - including text and 
multimedia - with various levels of structure. CLEF promotes research 
and development by providing an infrastructure for:

  * independent evaluation of information access systems;
  * investigation of the use of unstructured, semi-structured,
    highly-structured, and semantically enriched data in information access;
  * creation of reusable test collections for benchmarking;
  * exploration of new evaluation methodologies and innovative ways of
    using experimental data;
  * discussion of results, comparison of approaches, exchange of ideas,
    and transfer of knowledge.

CLEF 2018 will be the ninth edition of the current CLEF conference 
launched as a continuation of the annual CLEF evaluation campaign series 
which ran with great success from 2000 to 2009 contributing to the 
systematic evaluation of information access systems, primarily through 
experimentation on shared tasks.

*Scope of CLEF Labs

*Proposals are accepted for two different types of labs (see 2017 Lab at 
http://clef2017.clef-initiative.eu/index.php?page=Pages/labs_info.php):

  * Evaluation Labs that are a "campaign-style" evaluation for specific
    information access problems (during the twelve month period
    preceding the conference), similar in nature to the traditional CLEF
    campaign "tracks". Topics covered by campaign-style labs can be
    inspired by any information access-related domain or task.
  * Labs that follow a more classical "workshop" pattern, exploring
    issues of evaluation methodology, metrics, processes etc. in
    information access and closely related fields, such as natural
    language processing, machine translation, and human-computer
    interaction.

If the organisers of the proposal are new to CLEF or other shared task 
evaluation campaigns, we highly recommend that a lab workshop first be 
organised to discuss the format, the problem space, and the 
practicalities of the shared task. The CLEF 2018 programme will reserve 
about half of the conference schedule for lab sessions. The labs will 
present their overall results "overview presentations" during the 
plenary scientific paper sessions to allow non-participants to get a 
sense of where the research frontiers are moving. Organisers of each lab 
are expected to organise the separate sessions for their lab at the 
conference so that they contain ample time for general discussion and 
engagement by all participants - not just those presenting campaign 
results and papers. Organisers should plan time in their sessions for 
activities such as panels, demos, poster sessions etc. as appropriate. 
CLEF is always interested in receiving and facilitating innovative lab 
proposals. Potential task proposers who are unsure of the suitability of 
their task proposal or its format for inclusion at CLEF are encouraged 
to contact the CLEF 2018 Lab Organizing Committee Chairs to discuss its 
suitability or design at an early stage.

*Proposal Submission

*Lab proposals must provide sufficient information to judge the 
relevance, timeliness, scientific quality, benefits for the research 
community, and the competence of the proposers to co-ordinate the lab. 
Each lab proposal should identify one or more organizers as responsible 
for ensuring the timely execution of the lab. Proposals should be 3-4 
pages long and should provide the following information:

 1. Title of the proposed lab.
 2. A brief description of the lab topic and goals, its relevance to
    CLEF and the significance for the field.
 3. A brief but clear statement of usage scenarios or domain to which
    the activity is intended to contribute, including the evaluation
    setup and metrics.
 4. Details on the lab organizer(s), including identifying the task
    chair(s) responsible for ensuring the running of the task. This
    should include details of any previous of involvement in organising
    or participating in evaluation tasks at CLEF or similar campaigns.
 5. The planned format of the lab, i.e. campaign-style ("track") or
    workshop.
 6. Is the lab a continuation of an activity from previous year(s) or a
    new activity?
    a.    For activities continued from previous year(s): Statistics
    from previous years (number of participants/runs for each task), a
    clear statement on why another edition is needed, an explicit
    listing of the changes proposed, and a discussion of lessons to be
    learned or insights to be made.
    b.    For new activities: A statement on why a new evaluation
    campaign is needed and how the community would benefit from the
    activity.
 7. Details of the expected target audience, i.e. who do you expect to
    participate in the task(s), and how do you propose to reach them.
 8. Brief details of tasks to be carried out in the lab. The proposal
    should clearly motivate the need for each of the proposed tasks and
    provide evidence of its capability of attracting enough
    participation. The dataset which will be adopted by the Lab needs to
    be described and motivated in the perspective of the goals of the
    Labs; also indications on how the dataset will be shared are useful.
    It is fine for a lab to have a single task, but labs often contain
    multiple closely related tasks, needing a strong motivation for more
    than 3 tasks, to avoid useless fragmentation.
 9. Expected length of the lab session at the conference: half-day, one
    day, two days. This should include very high level details of
    planned structure of the session, e.g. participant presentations,
    invited speaker(s), panels, etc., to justify the requested session
    length.
10. Arrangements for the organization of the lab campaign: who will be
    responsible for activities within the task; how will data be
    acquired or created, what tools or methods will be used, e.g., how
    will necessary queries be created or relevance assessment carried
    out; any other information which is relevant to the conduct of your lab.
11. If the lab proposes to set up a steering committee to oversee and
    advise its activities, include names, addresses, and homepage links
    of people you propose to be involved.


*Reviewing Process

*Each submitted proposal will be reviewed by the CLEF 2018 lab 
organizing committee. The decision will be sent by email to the 
responsible organizer by September 13, 2017. The final length of the lab 
session will be determined based on the overall organization of the 
conference and the number of participant submissions received by a lab. 
Organizers of accepted labs are expected to announce and briefly present 
their lab at the final session of CLEF 2017 on the 14 September in 
Dublin, Ireland.

*Important Dates*

  * Final lab proposals: 3 September 2017
  * Notification of lab acceptance: 13 September 2017
  * Labs registration opens: 3 November 2017


*Submission Details

*Lab proposals (or questions) should be submitted in PDF format via 
EasyChair at the following link: 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clef2018.
Questions on lab proposals should be directed to the CLEF 2018 Lab Chairs:

                shared are useful. It is fine for a lab to have a single
                task, but labs often contain multiple closely related
                tasks, needing a strong motivation for more than 3
                tasks, to avoid useless fragmentation.</li>
              <li>Expected length of the lab session at the conference:
                half-day, one day, two days. This should include very
                high level details of planned structure of the session,
                e.g. participant presentations, invited speaker(s),
                panels, etc., to justify the requested session length.</li>
              <li>Arrangements for the organization of the lab campaign:
                who will be responsible for activities within the task;
                how will data be acquired or created, what tools or
                methods will be used, e.g., how will necessary queries
                be created or relevance assessment carried out; any
                other information which is relevant to the conduct of
                your lab.</li>
              <li>If the lab proposes to set up a steering committee to
                oversee and advise its activities, include names,
                addresses, and homepage links of people you propose to
                be involved.</li>
            </ol>

            <b>Reviewing Process<br>
              <br>
            </b>Each submitted proposal will be reviewed by the CLEF
            2018 lab organizing committee. The decision will be sent by
            email to the responsible organizer by September 13, 2017.
            The final length of the lab session will be determined based
            on the overall organization of the conference and the number
            of participant submissions received by a lab. Organizers of
            accepted labs are expected to announce and briefly present
            their lab at the final session of CLEF 2017 on the 14
            September in Dublin, Ireland.<br>
