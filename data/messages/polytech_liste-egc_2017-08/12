CALL FOR CHAPTER PROPOSALS

High-Utility Pattern Mining: Theory, Algorithms and Applications

Editors: Philippe Fournier-Viger, Chun-Wei Lin, Roger Nkambou, Bay Vo

Book to be published by Springer in 2018
============================================================================


IMPORTANT DATES

Chapter proposal deadline:    1st October 2017
Proposal acceptance date:    10th October 2017
Full chapter submission deadline: 15th January 2018
Planned publication date: 1st July 2018

INTRODUCTION

High utility pattern mining is a popular and emerging research area in the
field of data mining, which consists of discovering patterns of high
importance in databases. The importance of patterns can be expressed in
terms of various criteria such as the utility, weight or importance of
patterns. One of the major applications of utility mining is the analysis
of customer transaction databases to discover sets of items that generate a
high profit when purchased together. This book provides an introduction to
this field, reviews state-of-the-art techniques, and discusses recent
advances.

BOOKS AIMS

Presents an overview of the theory and core methods used in utility mining
Covers recent advances on high utility mining
Covers stream, incremental, sequence and the big data paradigm.
Discusses important applications and open-source software.
Topics of interest (not limited to):
high-utility itemset mining
high-utility sequential patterns and rules
high-utility episode mining
incremental high-utility itemset mining
utility mining in streams
utility mining in uncertain databases
utility mining in big data
concise representations of utility patterns
periodic, recent, high utility patterns
visualization techniques.
privacy preserving utility mining
open-source software
applications
A chapter can be either a survey of a topic of interest or be a research
paper.

SUBMISSION

Interested researchers are invited to submit a chapter proposal clearly
stating your focused problems and contributions related to one of the above
topics due on the 1st October 2017. This must include a proposed title,
abstract, author list with names/affiliations/e-mails, and a brief
description of the organization of your chapter in terms of sections and
content. Authors of accepted chapters will be notified by the 10th October
2017. Full chapters are due by the 15th January 2017. The Springer LaTeX
