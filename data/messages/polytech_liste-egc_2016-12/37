Cluster analysis is a well-known set of techniques and algorithms which seeks to form groups of data with both strong internal  similarity and strong external dissimilarity. In practice, this task is made harder by the presence of information in the data that is irrelevant to form the clusters, such as additional features, especially in the context of "big data" and high-dimensional data in  general.

To face this difficulty, in the recent years there has been a growing interest for new clustering techniques which identify clusters by means of different subspaces from the original data space, for example by weighting these features, identifying linear  subspaces where the data reside, or forming groups of correlated features which lead to clusters with high density.

  As for traditional clustering approaches, there exists a great diversity of choices and options regarding subspaces of interest. Various approaches to tackle this problem have been proposed by different communities of researchers. Some of the best  known of these groups include "subspace clustering", "projected clustering", "coclustering" (or "biclustering"), and "correlation clustering".

This special session aims to offer the opportunity for these communities to meet and exchange, with the specificities of soft clustering in mind.

  Important dates:
  *  Paper submission:                  January 25th, 2017
  *  Notification of acceptance:   March 10th, 2017
  *  Conference dates:                 July 9th – 12th, 2017


Main topics of interest include but are not limited to:
  * Soft approaches to subspace clustering, coclustering, ...
  * Soft clustering with features or subspace identification in non-euclidean spaces
  * Soft approaches to "self-expressive models"
  * Unsupervised metric learning for clustering
  * Unsupervised subspace nearest neighbor search
  * Applications of soft clustering with subspace identification to industrial and real-world problems


This special session is organized by:
  * Arthur Guillon, Université Pierre et Marie Curie
  * Marie-Jeanne Lesot, Université Pierre et Marie Curie
  * Christophe Marsala, Université Pierre et Marie Curie
  * Nikhil R. Pal, Indian Statistical Institute
