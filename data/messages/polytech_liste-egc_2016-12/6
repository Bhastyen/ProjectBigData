ESWC2017 =E2=80=93 last CALL FOR PAPERS
conference: 28 May to 1 June 2017 in Portoro=C5=BE, Slovenia
submission: 7 December (abstract) and 14 December 2016 (paper)
details: http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers =
<http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers>=20

ESWC is a major venue for discussing scientific results and innovations =
around semantic technologies. ESWC 2017 welcomes original research and =
application papers dealing with all aspects of semantics on the Web. We =
encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and applications =
papers. Papers should describe original work, present significant =
results, and provide rigorous, principled, and repeatable evaluation.


1) ESWC2017 PHD SYMPOSIUM (details: =
http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-phd =
<http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-phd>)
Early-stage or late-stage PhD students in all areas of the Semantic Web =
can submit a paper describing their PhD research. Submissions need to =
follow the template on the website.

2) ESWC2017 SPECIAL TRACKS (details: =
http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers/ =
<http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers/>)=20
The 2017 edition introduces two new tracks:
 =E2=80=93 Multilinguality
 =E2=80=93 Semantic Web and Transparency
Managing multilingual data requires semantic normalization and =
reconciliation to make the Semantic Web reach people around the world. =
Transparency concerns relationships between people and both commercial =
and authoritative entities, using semantic technologies with objectives =
varying from enabling trust to ensuring accountability.

3) ESWC2017 IN USE AND INDUSTRIAL TRACK (details: =
http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers#12 =
<http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers#12>)
This track demonstrates the impact of Semantic Web Technologies in =
concrete applications and in industry.

4) ESWC2017 RESEARCH TRACKS (details: =
http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers/ =
<http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/call-papers/>)=20
The 9 research tracks cover major current Semantic Web subdomains:
 =E2=80=93 Vocabularies, Schemas, Ontologies
 =E2=80=93 Reasoning
 =E2=80=93 Linked Data
 =E2=80=93 Social Web and Web Science
 =E2=80=93 Semantic Data Management, Big data, Scalability
 =E2=80=93 Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval
 =E2=80=93 Machine Learning
 =E2=80=93 Mobile Web, Sensors and Semantic Streams
 =E2=80=93 Services, APIs, Processes and Cloud Computing


DATES
=E2=80=93 abstract: 7 December 2016 (required, except PhD symposium)
=E2=80=93 paper: 14 December 2016
=E2=80=93 notification: 20 February 2017 (20 January for PhD symposium)

ABOUT ESWC2017
ESWC is one of the key academic conferences to present research results =
and new developments in the area of the Semantic Web. This endeavour =
naturally draws from and impacts on many disciplines of computing (and =
connected areas), related to data and information management, knowledge =
engineering, machine intelligence, human knowledge and languages, =
software services and applications. We are therefore seeking =
contribution to research at the intersection of the Semantic Web and =
these areas, as described in the 9 core research tracks of the =
conferences, as well as demonstration of the impact of Semantic Web =
Technologies in concrete applications and in industry, through the =E2=80=9C=
In Use and Industrial=E2=80=9D Track.
