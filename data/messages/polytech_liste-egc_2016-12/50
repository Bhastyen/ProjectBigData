Post-doctoral position in NLP / text mining

Title: detecting metaphors in scientific discourse
Place: ERIC Lab (Lyon, France)
Supervisors: Sabine Loudcher, Julien Velcin (ERIC Lab), Isabelle Lefort 
(EVS Lab).
Duration: 6 months
Salary: about 2000EUR per month (gross salary)

Context
Metaphor is a figure of speech that is broadly used in common language. 
It is grounded in the analogical process; it lets a word gets the 
meaning generally attributed to another word in a sentence. Metaphor is 
very much employed in scientific discourse, in particular in Social 
Sciences in which it is at the core of intellectual reasoning. People 
think first with those images. This explains why metaphor is a crucial 
issue to study, not only in language sciences and cognitive sciences, 
but also in geography in which it is employed by many researchers.
The automatic detection and interpretation of metaphors is a critical 
task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction 
(IE) as well.
In the fields of artificial intelligence and NLP, works on metaphor 
processing started in the 80s and they give us much information on the 
structure and the mechanisms of such phenomena. In the last decade, we 
witnessed a technological leap forward with an ever-increasing number of 
statistical-oriented techniques. In comparison with more traditional 
approaches based on manually-encoded knowledge, these recent techniques 
tend to have a greater coverage; they are less precise but gaining in 
efficiency and robustness. In this line, several approaches for metaphor 
detection have been proposed (Gedigian et al., 2006; Krishnakumaran and 
Zhu, 2007; Shutova et al., 2010). They rely on the use of a lexical 
resource such as WordNet, TreeBank, etc. Unfortunately, those lexical 
resources are mainly available in English, French and Spanish. For the 
other languages, either they are of low quality or they don't exist at 
all. Yulia Tsvetkov et al. (2013) propose a metaphor detection method 
that does not use such a lexical resource.
This proposal lies precisely in the recent trend of using machine 
learning for detecting and interpreting metaphors. In this post-doc, we 
focus on a specific social science that is Geography.

OBJECTIVE
The post-doctoral researcher will rely on a previous work done in the 
ERIC lab and the EVS lab. In particular, a manual encoding has been done 
on a small sample of articles and a first implementation based on a 
state-of-the-art method based on topic modeling has led to preliminary, 
highly promising results. S/he will work on the following tasks:
-        complete the implementation of the method of Heintz et al. 
(2013) by adding some post-processes and testing them on the available 
corpus (code in Python),
-        propose new ways to improve the approach, for instance by 
relying on word embedding techniques (several researchers in the ERIC 
lab are currently using those techniques),
-        co-supervise the acquisition of a huge corpus composed of 
articles in Geography and the (partial) manual annotation,
-        write a collaborative paper to be submitted to an international 
conference
-        perform a first temporal analysis of the metaphors (if time 
allows)


REQUESTED SKILLS
We expect candidates with a PhD in computer science / applied 
mathematics, specialized in natural language processing or text mining 
with strong programming skills (Python is the preferred language). Some 
knowledge in topic modeling would be a plus.

Please send your application including a CV, a cover letter along with 
recommendation letters (at least one) to Isabelle Lefort 
(isabelle.lefort@univ-lyon2.fr <mailto:isabelle.lefort@univ-lyon2.fr>),
