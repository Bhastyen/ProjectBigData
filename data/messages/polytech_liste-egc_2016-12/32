Call for Papers
=================
Papers are invited for KES2017 on topics lying within the scope of the conference. All contributions must be of high quality,
original, and must not have been previously published elsewhere or intended for publication elsewhere.
All papers will be reviewed by members of the International Programme Committee and depending on their level and attributes,
may be selected for oral or poster presentation, and publication in the conference proceedings.
Full papers will be reviewed by the IPC and if accepted and presented, they will be published in Elsevier's Procedia
Computer Science open access journal, available in ScienceDirect and submitted to be indexed/abstracted in CPCI (ISI
conferences and part of Web of Science), Engineering Index, and Scopus.
Authors of selected papers may be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for publication as
full journal papers, for example in the KES Journal or other journals.

=====================
  Call for Invited Sessions
=====================

An invited session consists of a presentation session of 6 to 12 or more papers on a specific conference topic, organised as half
or full day mini-conference. We invite senior scientists who have a special interest in a specific conference topic to take
responsibility for an invited session, gathering papers from a range of research expertise around the world.  Researchers
who would like to organise one or more Invited Sessions on topics falling within the scope of the conference are invited to submit
a proposal for consideration.

=========
  Location
=========

The KES2017 conference is being held at Aix-Marseille University, located at the historical campus of St Charles, in the centre
of the city of Marseille.
Marseille, is a port city in southern France, which has been a crossroads of immigration and trade since
its founding by the Greeks circa 600 B.C.
At its heart is the Vieux-Port (Old Port) and the Basilique Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde,  a Romanesque-Byzantine church.
Modern landmarks include Le Corbusier’s influential Cité Radieuse complex,  Zaha Hadid’s CMA CGM Tower,
and the iconic MuCEM designed by Rudy Ricciotti (built for the occasion of Marseille serving as the European Capital of
Culture for 2013).
