 International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis

================================================================================

  ICFCA 2017

  14th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis

  June 12—16, 2017, Rennes, France

  Web: <http://icfca2017.irisa.fr/>
  Mail: icfca2017@inria.fr

================================================================================

* Overview

Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980's from attempts to 
restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication 
between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since 
its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research 
field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a 
rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge 
processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge 
management and discovery.

The ICFCA conference series aims at bringing together researchers and
practitioners working on theoretical or applied aspects of Formal 
Concept Analysis within major related areas such as Mathematics and 
Computer and Information Sciences and their diverse applications to 
fields like Software Engineering, Linguistics, Life and Social Sciences, 
etc.

All accepted submissions will be refereed, and the conference 
proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS/LNAI series.

* Topics

Main topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

** Fundamental aspects of FCA

- FCA theory
- Lattice theory
- Lattice drawing
- Philosophical foundations
- Algorithms and complexity theory

** Bridging FCA to information sciences and artificial intelligence

- FCA and logic, e.g., semantic web, description logics
- FCA and conceptual structures, e.g., concept graphs, knowledge spaces
- FCA and data analysis, e.g., hierarchical classification, data 
organization
- FCA and data mining, e.g., pattern mining
- FCA and information retrieval, e.g. exploratory search, navigation, 
querying
- FCA and machine learning, e.g., learning with hypothesis, feature 
selection
- FCA and database theory, e.g., dependencies, rules, data cubes
- FCA and software engineering
- FCA and morphological mathematics

** Understanding, modelling real-world data and phenomena with FCA

- Analysis of "big data" with FCA, e.g., sampling, parallel computing
- Analysis of social networks and their dynamics
- Applications for scientific data analysis, e.g., in biology or health care
- Applications for sensors data and user interactions traces
- Other FCA applications

* Submission Details

We invite scientific publications on theory and applications of Formal 
Concept Analysis.  Papers of up to sixteen pages may be submitted in the 
PDF format via the Easychair system

   <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfca2017>.

Authors are requested to follow the formatting instructions for the 
Springer LNCS style.[1]
Submissions in LaTeX2e are preferred.  Authors are encouraged to provide 
an ORCID alongside their submission.[2]

Accepted papers have to be presented at the conference.  Therefore, at 
least one author per paper has to register timely.
