Call for Papers


Data Warehouse (DW) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) technologies =
are the core of current Decision Support Systems. The widespread =
deployment of both DWs and OLAP technologies is due to the intuitive =
representation of data and simple primitives provided to data analysts =
or managers in support of management decisions. Research in data =
warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, =
management, and use of information systems for decision support.=20

Business Intelligence (BI) of the future will be significantly different =
than what the current state-of-the-practice supports. The trend is to =
move from the current decision support systems that are "data =
presenting" to more dynamic systems that allow the semi- automation of =
the decision making process. This means that the systems partially guide =
their users towards data discovery, intuition, and system-aided decision =
making via intelligent techniques and visualization. In the back stage, =
the thrust of the big data era, with the requires that new methods, =
models, techniques, or architecture are needed to cope with the =
increasing demand in capacity, data type diversity, and responsiveness. =
And of course, this does not necessarily mean to re-invent the wheel, =
but rather, as recommended by Gartner to companies regarding BD =
adoption, "Build on existing BI programs - don't abandon or segregate =
them". We envision DOLAP 2018 as a venue where novel ideas around these =
new landscapes of business intelligence and big data are fostered and =
nurtured and new exciting results are produced, in an attempt to build a =
strong, vibrant community around these areas.

Research topics include, but are not limited to:

Design and Languages

Data warehousing fundamentals: architectures, design, ETL/ELT, =
multidimensional modeling, query processing, DW maintenance, evolution, =
security, personalization and privacy in data warehouses=20
Warehousing and Variety: unstructured data (e.g., text), semi-structured =
data (e.g., XML), multimedia, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal =
data warehouses, stream and sensor data, semantic Web & deep Web in data =
warehouses, data lakes, data quality, graph data management=20
Optimization
Coping with Volume: physical organization of data warehouses, =
performance optimization and tuning, scalability of DW, MapReduce in =
data warehouses, performance optimization of ETL/ELT=20
Coping with Velocity: DW deployment on parallel machine, database =
clusters, cloud infrastructures for DW, smart grid, active/real-time =
analytics & data warehouses, real-time queries=20
Analytical Processing and applications
Analytics and Value: OLAP exploration through visualization, =
recommendation, reformulation, approximate query-answering, =
personalization, result presentation, data storytelling, graph =
analytics, process mining, advanced visualization for business contexts=20=

Analytics and Veracity: heterogeneous data integration for analtyics, =
quality aspects of OLAP analysis, exploration outcome and end-user =
experience, fairness of data analysis, analytics and data driven =
decision making for the data enthusiasts=20
Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, information =
retrieval, search engines, predictive and prescriptive analytics=20
Big Data applications: smart city, smart health, smart energy, etc.=20
Submission types:

Authors can submit:=20

short papers (of maximum 5 pages) including vision, PhD, demos, and =
preliminary works to be discussed with the community=20
long papers (of maximum 10 pages) including novel research =
contributions, an architecture of a commercial system or solution, =
results of case studies and experience report, survey papers, or =
on-going work on a challenging and emerging area=20
Publication:

Similarly as in previous years, the proceedings of DOLAP 2019 shall be =
submitted to CEUR-WS.org <http://ceur-ws.org/> for online publication =
(open access) and will be indexed by Citeseer, DBLP, and Google Scholar.
