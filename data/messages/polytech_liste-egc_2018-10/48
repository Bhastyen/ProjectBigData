Subject: [liste-egc] Two postdoctoral positions on machine learning and
 speech processing

Inria is seeking 2 postdoctoral researchers for a new European (H2020 
ICT) collaborative project called COMPRISE. COMPRISE is a 3-year 
Research and Innovation Action (RIA) aiming at new cost-effective, 
multilingual, privacy-driven voice interaction technology. This will be 
achieved through research advances in privacy-driven machine learning, 
personalized training, automatic data labeling, and tighter integration 
of speech and dialog processing with machine translation. The technology 
will be based on existing software toolkits (Kaldi speech-to-text, 
Platon dialog processing, Tilde text-to-speech), as well as new software 
resulting from these research efforts.

The consortium includes academic and industrial partners in France 
(Inria <https://www.inria.fr/en/>, Netfective Technology 
<https://www.bluage.com/>), Germany (Ascora <https://ascora.net/>, 
Saarland University <https://www.uni-saarland.de/nc/en/home.html>), 
Latvia (Tilde <https://www.tilde.com/>), and Spain (Rooter 
<https://www.rooter.es/home>). The successful candidates will be part of 
the Multispeech team in Nancy or the Magnet team in Lille. Both teams 
will work in tight collaboration.

Topics include:

* weakly-supervised, semi-supervised learning, learning with partial
feedback
* theoretical aspects and formal guarantees in private machine learning,
* representation learning and deep learning for speech processing,
* learning on the edge, federated learning and personalized learning.

Both theoretical and practical aspects will be developed, possibly by 
different candidates depending on their skills.

*Desired profile:*

Two alternative profiles are welcome, either:

* strong background in mathematics, machine learning, statistics and
algorithms,

or

* strong experience with implementation and experimentation, speech
processing,

*Application deadline:* Dec 17, 2018. Applications will be assessed on a 
rolling basis; please apply as soon as possible.

*Starting date:* January 1, 2019 or later
*Duration:* 2 years (renewable)
*Location:* Lille, Nancy, France
*Salary:* from 2,130 to 2,520 EUR net/month, according to experience
