**********************************************************************=


Informatics Europe proudly announces the third Minerva Informatics Equa=
lity Award devoted to initiatives which seek to encourage and support t=
he careers of women in Informatics research and education. The third of=
 this annual award will be presented in October 2018 and is sponsored b=
y Google.

The Informatics Europe Minerva Informatics Equality Award recognizes be=
st practices in Departments or Faculties of European Universities or Re=
search Institutes and Labs that have been demonstrated to have a positi=
ve impact for women. On a three-year cycle the award will focus each ye=
ar on a different stage of the career pipeline:

 * Developing the careers of female faculty, including retention and pr=
omotion;
 * Supporting the transition of female PhD and postdoctoral researchers=
 into faculty positions;
 * Encouraging female students to enroll in Computer Science/Informatic=
s programmes and retaining them.

The 2018 Award is devoted to initiatives encouraging female students to=
 enroll in Computer Science/Informatics programmes and retaining them.=


The Award seeks to celebrate successful initiatives that have had a mea=
surable impact on the recruitment and support of female students within=
 the institution. Such initiatives can serve as exemplars of best pract=
ices within the community, with the potential to be widely adopted by o=
ther institutions.
Nominations will need to demonstrate the impact that has been achieved.=


For 2018 examples of impact could include fostering gender balance in a=
ll aspects of students=E2=80=99 education, better admission, recruitmen=
t and graduation rates for female students, better gender ratio of stud=
ents receiving stipends, scholarships and other financial support, impr=
oved curriculum, designed based on gender analysis, as recorded in obje=
ctive surveys of staff and student experience, etc.

*The Award carries a prize of EUR 5,000.*

The Award will be given to a Department or Faculty to be used for furth=
er work on enforcing the recruitment and support of female students. To=
 be eligible, nominated institutions must be located in one of the memb=
er or candidate member countries of the Council of Europe, or Israel. I=
nstitutions associated with members of the Informatics Europe Board and=
 of the Award panel are not eligible.

The Award panel will review and evaluate each proposal. It reserves the=
 right to split the prize between different applications. Moreover, not=
eworthy runners up may also be included as exemplars of best practice i=
n future Informatics Europe publications.
