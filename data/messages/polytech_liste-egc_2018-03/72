LAST CALL FOR PAPERS

29th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications - DEXA 2018

Regensburg, Germany
September 3 - 6, 2018

http://www.dexa.org/dexa2018

Database, information, and knowledge systems have always been a core subject of computer science. The ever increasing need to distribute, exchange, and integrate data, information, and knowledge has added further importance to this subject. Advances in the field will help facilitate new avenues of communication, to proliferate interdisciplinary discovery, and to drive innovation and commercial opportunity. Since 1990, DEXA has been an annual international conference which showcases state-of-the-art research activities in database, information, and knowledge systems. DEXA provides a forum to present research results and to examine advanced applications in the field. The conference and its associated workshops offer an opportunity for developers, scientists, and users to extensively discuss requirements, problems, and solutions in database, information, and knowledge systems. DEXA 2018 will be held in Regensburg, Germany, from September 3-6, 2018.

Submissions:
DEXA 2018 invites research submissions on all topics related to database, information, and knowledge systems including, but not limited to the points in the list below. We also welcome survey papers, provided that the survey fills a void or goes beyond existing overview papers.

* The submitted manuscript must be submitted in pdf in LNCS format (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)
* The length of submitted manuscripts should not exceed 15 pages.
* Any submission that significantly exceeds length limits or deviates from formatting requirements may be rejected without review.

For paper registration and electronic submission see:http://confdriver.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dexa2018

Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.
Duplicate submissions are not allowed. Authors are expected to agree to the following terms: "I understand that the submission must not overlap substantially with any other paper that I am a co-author of or that is currently submitted elsewhere. Furthermore, previously published papers with any overlap are cited prominently in this submission."
Duplicate submissions will be rejected immediately without review. Questions about this policy or how it applies to your work should be directed to the PC-chairs.

ACCEPTED PAPERS:
All accepted conference papers will be published in a volume of "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" (LNCS) by Springer Verlag. DEXA reserves the right to accept papers only as short papers (up to 8 pages). Short papers describe interesting and innovative ideas which still require further technical development. Authors of all accepted papers must sign a Springer copyright release form. Papers are accepted with the understanding that at least one author will register for the conference to present the paper. Papers without any registered co-author will not be published.

Authors of selected papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for publication in the Springer journal Transactions of Large Scale Data and Knowledge Centered Systems (TLDKS). The submitted extended versions will undergo a further review process.
