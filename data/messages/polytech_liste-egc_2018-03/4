The project networking track is intended to provide national and EU =

have results to transfer as well as recently started EU and national =
projects, which are seeking datasets and tools to perform their work.=20

extended abstract (PDF, Springer LNCS style). The abstract should =
introduce the project, briefly describe its R&D activities and goals and =

focused specifically on what the project plans to offer to other =
projects and/or wishes to request from other projects. This should be =
backed up by links to online datasets, tools or use cases where =
requirements are identified.=20

There will be a limited number of places for projects in the networking =
space. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to =
ESWC2018, tangible innovation and uniqueness in the R&D activities and a =
