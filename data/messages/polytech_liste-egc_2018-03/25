Stage / Internship 6 months at the ETIS Lab UMR 8051
(University Paris Seine, University of Cergy Pontoise, ENSEA, CNRS)

Title
Capturing twitter streams for opinion mining on airport noise

Supervisors
Dimitris Kotzinos, ETIS, =C3=A9quipe MIDI
Catherine Lavandier, ETIS, =C3=A9quipe Neuro

Description
Understanding the opinion of the users on specific matters (like events,
public issues/debates, other people) is a hard task to be done
automatically and for any event. But with the expansion of social media
use, we have a source of information where people express (sometimes
passionately) their opinions and participate in discussions, which we
can track as they happen. Recently, social media are used to substitute
traditional surveying methods like on the spot interviews or phone or
web surveys. In this project, we plan to do the same but to limit our
research on users who live in the area of the airport and discuss about
noise problems emanating from the landing and takeoff of aircraft.
The collected information can be used in several ways:
(1)	At the social media level, we can monitor discussions and exchanges
over airport generated noise issues and try to understand if there are
particular events that concern the users. We can analyze both the volume
of a conversation in terms of numbers of posts and users but also the
connections among these users (their social graph) and understand the
possible influences and influencers.
(2)	Tracking events through discussions on social media would allow us
to also understand whether something out of the ordinary has happened
and how the involved parties are reacting to this (e.g. through
increased number of posts, etc.). This would require real time
monitoring of the users' interactions on social media.
The main goal of the work in this project will be the setup of a
customizable platform that will be able to capture the stream of
relevant tweets generated by the users, store it offline, identify the
users involved in the discussions and build the social networks of
discussions around them. Also we would like to characterize the
discussions based on location and relevance to the subject of our
research (airport noise).
We will do this by applying text mining and information retrieval
techniques, combined with opinion mining techniques from social media
texts and network analytics in order to analyze and build the correct
social graph of the involved users.
This work is part of the EU-funded research project ANIMA.

Candidate
