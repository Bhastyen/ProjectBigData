Subject: [liste-egc] Post-doctoral position in Hydrogen storage materials
 designed by Machine Learning, Paris

Postdoctoral position on "Hydrogen storage materials designed by  
Machine Learning"
1 year, to be started before 1st June 2018 in ICMPE ? CNRS (Thiais,  
8km south of Paris, France)

Objectives of the project

The storage of a "clean" energy is a key issue for the future, where  
hydrogen may play an important role. However, its storage still  
remains a technological challenge, where a safe and effective answer  
could be the use of metal hydrides, in which hydrogen atom is bonded  
to a metallic matrix. In this project, we are planning to use the  
machine learning (ML) approach to design new materials as metal  
hydrides for efficient hydrogen storage.

Job description

First of all, the postdoctoral researcher will build a robust  
database. This database will contain both crystallographic data, like  
pair distances distribution and stability/metastability information  
for each compound, like the heat of formation. The input data is  
coming from known crystal structures database and massive Density  
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations already partly performed.
Then, the postdoctoral researcher will evaluate several ML algorithms  
on different criteria like supervised or not, discriminative or  
generative. Among algorithms, several ways will be investigated as  
classical neural networks (deep learning), but also new and emerging  
techniques will be considered, like the Generative Adversarial  
Networks (GAN) which is already under investigation at the ICMPE.  
Finally, we expect to get prediction of new phases from an original  
chemical composition. In addition, a self-consistent procedure is  
envisaged: the stability of predicted new phases will be estimated by  
DFT and will be used as new input data using reinforcement learning.

Desired skills and experience

Eligible candidates should have a Ph.D. degree and experience in  
machine learning or data sciences, additional computational chemistry  
experience will be appreciated. The successful candidate should have  
substantial previous experiences in database building. Experience in  
scripting languages such as Matlab and/or Python is highly mandatory.  
A deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms is also fundamental.  
Daily interactions with solid state chemists will be required, and  
therefore a crystallography background is valuable but not mandatory.

About the employer

The ICMPE (Institut de Chimie et des Matériaux de Paris Est) is a  
CNRS/UPEC institute doing research on solid state chemistry. The team  
where the postdoc will be hires is skilled on crystallography,  
thermodynamic modelling and DFT calculations on metal hydrides.  
Machine learning is an emerging discipline in the team who  
collaborates already with partners in Paris.

Contacts

Application (detailed CV + motivation letter) and requests for more  
information has to be sent to Jean-Claude Crivello  
(crivello@icmpe.cnrs.fr) by email with ?Apply for ML postdoc? as a  
subject.
