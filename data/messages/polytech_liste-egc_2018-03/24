Deadline Extension: 4th Workshop on Sentic Computing, Sentiment =
Analysis, Opinion Mining, and Emotion Detection
at ESWC, Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 2018
Workshop URL: http://www.maurodragoni.com/research/opinionmining/events/
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

With the rapid growth of Web a plethora of information is being =
published on-line by users on social networks,
online communities, blogs, wikis, etc. This collective intelligence has =
spread to many different areas, with particular
focus on fields related to everyday life such as commerce, tourism, =
education, and health, causing the size of the social Web to expand =
exponentially.

To identify the emotions (e.g. sentiment polarity, sadness, happiness, =
anger, irony, sarcasm, etc.) and the modality (e.g. doubt, certainty, =
obligation, liability, desire, etc.)
expressed in this continuously growing content is critical to enable the =
correct interpretation of the opinions expressed
or reported about social events, political movements, company =
strategies, marketing campaigns, product preferences, etc. by the =
masses.
This has attracted the attention of scientific community, by providing =
it with new research challenges, as well as in the business world,
as applications such as marketing and financial prediction would gain =
remarkable benefits.

Based on the lessons learned from the three previous editions, this year =
the scope of the workshop is a bit broader (although still
focusing on a very specific domain) and accepted submissions will =
include abstracts and position papers in addition to full papers.
The workshop's main focus will be discussion rather than presentations, =
which are seen as seeds for boosting discussion topics, and an expected
result will be a joint manifesto and a research roadmap that will =
provide the Semantic Web community with inspiring research challenges.

=3D=3D TOPICS =3D=3D

The main topics include but are not limited to:

* Ontologies and knowledge bases for emotion recognition
* Topic and entity based emotion recognition
* Semantics in the evolution of emotions within and across social media =
systems and topics
* Semantic processing of social media for emotion recognition
* Contextualised emotion recognition
* Comparison of semantic approaches for emotion recognition
* Personalised semantic emotion recognition and monitoring
* Using semantics for prediction of emotions towards events, people, =
organisations, etc.
* Baselines and datasets for semantic emotion recognition
* Semantics in stream-based emotion recognition
* Comparison between semantic and non-semantic approaches for emotion =
recognition
* Multimodal emotion recognition
* Multilingual sentiment analysis
* Challenges in using semantics for emotion recognition
* Retrieval of emotion-based documents from repositories
* Deep learning and knowledge-enabled approaches for sentiment analysis
* Big Data tools and techniques for sentiment analysis
* Applications of sentiment analysis within specific domains (e.g. =
health, robotics)

=3D=3D IMPORTANT DATES =3D=3D

March 17, 2018, 23:59 CET: Full, Short, and Position papers submission =

April 13, 2018, 23:59 CET: Camera-ready paper due
ESWC 2018 Workshop day: June 3rd, 2018, the whole day

=3D=3D SUBMISSION GUIDELINES =3D=3D

* Papers must comply with the LNCS style.
* Papers are submitted in PDF format via the workshop=E2=80=99s =
EasyChair submission pages =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Demsasw2018  (remember to =
select the Workshop topic)

Submissions can fall in one of the following categories:
- Full research papers (up to 8-10 pages)
- Short research papers (up to 4-6 pages)
- Position papers (2 pages)

Accepted papers will be published by CEUR=E2=80=93WS. The best paper =
(according to the reviewers=E2=80=99 rate) will be published within the =
main conference proceedings.
At least one of the authors of the accepted papers must register for the =
workshop (pre-conference only option) to be included into the workshop =
proceedings.
