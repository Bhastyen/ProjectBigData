SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Since its establishment as a software design style, Service Oriented 
Architectures have taken the ICT world by storm. The Lego pieces logic 
thrived through Cloud Computing and it is now considered the standard 
approach in practically every application framework. The keyword for 
this success is adaptivity: Service Oriented Architectures are 
implemented through a wide range of technologies and tools leading to 
numerous combinations that meet the application requirements in the 
desired way.

But there is a specific combination of application characteristics and 
requirements that seemingly put SOAs to the test: data-intensive tasks 
coupled with performance and temporal requirements. The challenge is 
justified because SOAs are simply not meant to deal with shifting large 
data volumes between nodes. And unfortunately this is a common problem 
nowadays: IoT and big data applications are simply two general 
application categories that come with exactly those characteristics and 
-more often than not- with the said temporal requirements. To a certain 
extent the problem is mitigated through the increase of the SOA 
infrastructure's computing and storage node density while “stretching” 
them at the same time. Edge and fog computing as well as lambda services 
are emerging trends that validate the concept.

This special session invites research communities from a diverse set of 
scientific areas such as cloud, distributed, parallel and 
high-performance computing to publish their work and share opinions 
about applications, challenges and viable solutions to the potential new 
systems emerging from the need to deal with data intensive application 
tasks within a SOA and services computing framework.

The SerCo Session topics include (but are not limited to) the following:
The special session seeks works dealing with topics that revolve around 
the general combination of SOA, data intensive applications and temporal 
requirements. The technology space for this work may relate to the 
following not-limited list of technologies and use cases:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAPER SUBMISSIONS
You are invited to submit original and unpublished research works on 
above and other topics related to High Performance Services Computing 
and Internet/Web Technologies. Submitted papers must not have been 
published or simultaneously submitted elsewhere until it appears in HPCS 
proceedings, in the case of acceptance, or notified otherwise. For 
Regular papers, please submit a PDF copy of your full manuscript, not to 
exceed 8 double-column formatted pages per template, and include up to 6 
keywords and an abstract of no more than 400 words. Additional pages 
will be charged additional fee. Submission should include a cover page 
with authors' names, affiliation addresses, fax numbers, phone numbers, 
and all authors email addresses. Please, indicate clearly the 
corresponding author(s) although all authors are equally responsible for 
the manuscript. Short papers (up to 4 pages), poster papers and posters 
(please refer to 
http://hpcs2018.cisedu.info/1-call-for-papers-and-participation/call-for-posters 
for posters submission details) will also be considered. Please specify 
the type of submission you have.  Please include page numbers on all 
preliminary submissions to make it easier for reviewers to provide 
helpful comments.

Submit a PDF copy of your full manuscript to the special session paper 
submission site at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=serco2018
Acknowledgement will be sent within 48 hours of submission.

Conference Policies
Only PDF files will be accepted, uploaded to the submission link above.  
Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Papers will be 
selected based on their originality, relevance, significance, technical 
clarity and presentation, language, and references.  Submission implies 
the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present 
the paper, if accepted.  At least one of the authors of each accepted 
paper will have to register and attend the HPCS 2018 conference to 
present the paper at the special session as scheduled. By submitting the 
paper to the HPCS conference, all authors agree to abide by all HPCS 
conference paper submission, publication and presentation policies as 
well as following ethical and professional codes of conduct, including 
those of the professional co-sponsoring organizations. For more 
information, please refer to the Authors Info and Registration Info pages.

Proceedings
Accepted papers will be published in the Conference proceedings. 
Instructions for final manuscript format and requirements will be posted 
on the HPCS 2018 Conference web site. It is our intent to have the 
proceedings formally published in hard and soft copies and be available 
at the time of the conference. The proceedings are projected to be 
included in the IEEE or ACM Digital Library and indexed in all major 
indexing services accordingly.

SPECIAL ISSUE
Plans are underway to have the best papers, in extended version, 
selected for possible publication in a reputable journal as special 
issue. Detailed information will soon be announced and will be made 
available on the conference website.

If you have any questions about paper submission or the special session, 
please contact the special session organizers.
