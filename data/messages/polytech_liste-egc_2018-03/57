Subject: [liste-egc] PhD Thesis Offer: Extraction and Characterization of
 Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Videos

We propose a PhD position on video analysis. More specifically, we are =
interested in identification and characterization of trajectories in =
videos. Contrary to common trajectories corresponding to the movement of =
identifiable objects in videos (tracking of a person, a vehicle, etc.), =
the goal of this work will be rather on the analysis of the movement of =
a set of objects forming an heterogeneous "mass", like some fluids, =
human crowds, or animal swarms, for example. Therefore, with respect to =
the above context, this thesis will focus on three highly interdependent =
aspects:

	=E2=80=A2 Discovery and extraction of several spatio-temporal =
patterns that are specific from studied video sequences;

	=E2=80=A2 Joint analysis of these patterns along the time =
(multi-trajectory/sequence analysis).

	=E2=80=A2 Use of machine learning procedures (in particularly =
deep learning [6]) to facilitate the

discovery and analysis of such patterns and sequences.

The extraction of spatio-temporels patterns should allow to characterize =
locally the movements observable in the video ([7, 8]). In order to do =
this, we should be able to build some spatio-temporal descriptors based =
on dictionaries for example. One way to extract these patterns could be =
to use deep learning techniques. Once obtained, these patterns can be =
mixed together to build sequences.

The next step is to analyze these sequences to find more complex =
behaviours such as reoccurrence of subsequences, abnormal subsequences, =
etc. For this, we will focus on the use of data mining methods (sequence =
mining [1, 2, 3]), as well as sequence matching techniques [4, 5] and =
pattern recognition techniques [6], that will have to be adapted to the =
specificities of the videos. In particular, the goal will not be to work =
on a unique sequence but jointly with several ones that will =
characterize the behaviour of the heterogenous =E2=80=9Cmass=E2=80=9D =
observed in the video.

The results of this thesis will be applied first to the analysis of =
fluid movements in engine cooling galleries, a problem related to an =
in-progress collaborative research work with researchers at Zhejiang =
University in China. Depending on results this shall lead to the =
submission of an international collaborative project to continue and =
expand the work. This work can also be applied to many other application =
domains, such as the analysis of heterogeneous fluid videos, the =
video-surveillance of human/animal populations, and, in particular, the =
analysis of crowds, especially on touristic sites.
