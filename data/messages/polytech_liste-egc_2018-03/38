Thanks for sending the announcement to anyone possibly interested.


The TAU research group  (CNRS / INRIA / Univ. Paris-Sud) offers a 
postdoc position funded by the Nutriperso Initiative of Strategic Research.

Goal: characterize *who* eats *what *based on proprietary data on 
detailed food intake, with 20,000 households over 20 years;
Our agenda: unveil the relationships between food intake, health, 
wealth, family habits.

Candidates with expertise in machine learning (python), natural language 
processing, statistics, computational sociology, are welcome.

*The group*
Our research group is  a multidisciplinary team of researchers (computer 
science, maths, statistical physics, sociology, biology) interested in 
machine learning with an impact on real life, with expertise in deep 
learning, causal modelling, continuous models, optimization, and 
interests in natural and social sciences.

*How to apply*
Interested candidates should submit a one-page description of research 
interests and plans, a resume, and contact information for three 
references to Michele Sebag and Philippe Caillou (sebag@lri.fr, 
caillou@lri.fr).

*Date*: As soon as possible. Before May, 2018

*More*
Interested candidates are welcome to contact us for more detail.

*Position*: postdoc at INRIA, funded by University Paris-Saclay, 
Nutriperso Project.

*Location*: Lab. of Computer Science, Shannon building, Univ. Paris-Sud.
