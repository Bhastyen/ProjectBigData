The Zenith team of Inria ( https://team.inria.fr/zenith/ ) is seeking a pos=
tdoctoral fellow in time series analytics, in collaboration with Safran ( h=
ttps://www.safran-group.com/ ).=20




* Title: Similarity Search in Large Scale Time Series=20




* Topic:=20

Nowadays, sensors technology is improving, and the number of sensors used f=
or collecting information from different environments is increasing, e.g., =
from critical systems such as airplane engines. This huge utilization of se=
nsors results in the production of large scale data, usually in the form of=
 time series. With such complex and massive sets of time series, fast and a=
ccurate similarity search is a key to perform many data mining tasks like S=
hapelets, Motifs Discovery, Classification or Clustering.=20

This PostDoc position is proposed in the context of collaboration between t=
he INRIA Zenith team and Safran (a multinational company specialized in the=
 aircraft and rocket engines). We are interested in the correlation detecti=
on over multi dimensional time series, e.g. generated by engine check tests=
. For instance given a time slice (generated using a set of input parameter=
s) of a very large time series, the objective is to detect quickly the time=
 slice that is the most similar to it, and by this to find the input parame=
ter values that generate similar outputs.=20

One of the distinguishing features of our underlying application is the hug=
e volume of data to be analyzed. To deal with such a dataset, we intend to =
develop scalable solutions that take advantage of parallel frameworks (such=
 as Mapreduce, Spark or Flink) that allow us to make efficient parallel dat=
a mining systems over ordinary machines. We will capitalize on our recent p=
rojects where we developed parallel solutions for indexing and analyzing ve=
ry large datasets, e.g. [YAMP2017, SAM2017, SAM2015, AHMP2015].=20

One possibility for scalable correlation detection in this project is to bu=
ild on top of related work, including the matrix profile index [YZUB+2016] =
over time series generated by thousands of sensors. One of the tasks, in th=
e context of this project, will be to develop distributed solutions for con=
structing and exploiting such indexes over large scale time series coming f=
rom massively distributed sensors.=20
