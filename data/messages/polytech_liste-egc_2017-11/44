CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS (2 Weeks left!!)

The Fifteenth European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2018)
June 3rd - June 7th, 2018, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.

Call for Workshops
* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

ESWC is a premier venue for discussing the latest scientific results and =
innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and Linked =
Data, attracting a high number of participants from academia and =
industry alike. Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are essential =
meeting points for discussing ongoing work and late-breaking results, as =
well as shaping new ideas and research fields. We particularly invite =
workshop proposals looking at Semantic Web related topics from an =
interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals focussing on novel aspects of =
the Semantic Web and Web of Data, and proposals aiming at gathering =
existing and forming new sub-communities. We encourage the submission of =
workshop proposals on:

- Fundamental technical and theoretical problems of the Semantic Web / =
Linked Data and Knowledge Graph,
- Applications of Semantic Web technologies in domains such as Mobility =
and Smart Cities, Life Sciences, Industry 4.0, Earth Science, Digital =
Humanities, Law, Media, etc.,
- Key enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the =
Semantic Web,
- Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected or =
underrepresented so far,=20
- Techniques and methods from other research fields that are of =
relevance for Semantic Web research (e.g., artificial intelligence, =
databases, NLP, big data analytics, machine learning, human computer =
interaction, information retrieval, web science, etc.), and
- New emerging topics and areas

In particular, we also encourage the submission of workshops that do not =
follow the format of a mini-conference. Preference will be given to =
workshops fostering alternative formats, e.g., hackathons, demo jams, or =
breakout sessions.

General Information and Criteria

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme =
committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and =
the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their =
recommendations will determine the final decision on the acceptance / =
rejection of each proposal, which is to be taken by the Workshop Chairs =
as well as by the General Chair of ESWC 2017.
The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as =
follows:

- Workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESWC =
conference.
- Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not =
mini-conferences.
- We welcome workshops with creative structures and organisations that =
attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
- Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology, problem =
or application.
- There is a community interested in the workshop's topic.
- Workshop duration is normally expected to be half a day or a full day.
- We strongly advise having more than one organiser and no more than =
four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different =
perspectives to the workshop topic.=E2=80=8B

In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the Workshop Chairs may =
contact the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. =
Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted =
based on the overall number of workshop submissions received. =
Furthermore, workshops that have less than 10 people registered at the =
early registration deadline might be canceled.
The organisers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own =
reviewing process, publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for =
papers), and proceedings production, if required. The organisers will =
also be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop Chairs and the =
ESWC 2018 Local Chairs to finalise all organisational details. Workshop =
attendees must pay the ESWC 2018 workshop registration fee, as well as =
the conference registration fee.

Submission Guidelines
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Workshop proposals have to be submitted via EasyChair at =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Deswc2018wt.

Each proposal must consist of a single PDF document written in English, =
not longer than four pages, which contains the following information:
- The title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying =
its goals and motivation.
- A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this =
time.
- A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest, =
the workshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
- A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, =
discussing the mix of events and activities such as paper presentations, =
invited talks, panels, hacking sessions, breakout sessions, or general =
discussion slots, and an approximate timeline.
- A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% =
have to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
- An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a =
half-day or full-day event.
- Related workshops and conferences, i.e. specify if this is the =
continuation of a workshop series or is a new workshop to address an =
emerging issue. Please provide information about past versions of this =
workshop and other related workshops (including URLs and submission / =
acceptance counts, if available).
- Names and contact information of the workshop organisers/chair(s) =
(name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph) =
biography of each chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the =
workshop including past experience in organising / facilitating =
workshops). Preferably provide a single contact person per submission.

The best papers from each workshop may be included in the supplementary =
proceedings of ESWC 2018, which will appear in the Springer LNCS series.

Call for Tutorials
* * * * * * * * * * * *

ESWC is a premier venue for discussing the latest scientific results and =
innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and Linked =
Data, attracting a high number of participants from academia and =
industry alike. ESWC 2018 invites tutorials that address the interests =
of its varied audience: people new to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web =
researchers and practitioners that wish to learn new technologies, users =
of Semantic Web technologies, and representatives of government and =
funding agencies as well as potential private investors in Semantic Web =
technologies. We welcome submissions of tutorial proposals on all major =
topics related to semantic technologies.
We especially solicit proposals for tutorials of the following types:
- Tutorials with a coherent theme providing an introduction to new =
semantic technologies, methods, techniques, and trends (e.g. Linked Open =
Data, Knowledge Graph, semantic data integration, reasoning,question =
answering, ontology-based data access, ontology design principles, =
provenance and trust, etc.).
- Tutorials describing the application of semantic technologies in =
specific domains (e.g., life-sciences, e-government, e-commerce, =
cultural heritage, educations, mobile, music, etc.).
- Tutorials presenting techniques from other fields that are of =
relevance for Semantic Web research, including social sciences, digital =
humanities, biomedical research, HCI, Information Retrieval, databases, =
NLP, Internet of Things, data visualization, etc.
Tutorials may focus on theoretical topics, however, we encourage =
organizers to incorporate hands-on sessions where appropriate. The =
tutorial should reach a good balance between the topic coverage and its =
relevance to the community.
Tutorials can be half a day or a full day.
We suggest having up to two presenters for half day tutorials and up to =
four presenters for full day ones, preferably from different =
institutions, contributing different perspectives to the tutorial topic.
