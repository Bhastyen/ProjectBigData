PostDoc position in Learning Analytics for Higher Education
Universit=C3=A9 de Lorraine, LORIA, France

Context
The always broader usage of digital tools in all educational sectors =
leads to large or even very large sets of digital user-generated traces, =
collected via online pedagogical platforms, academic enrolment, =
libraries information systems, online assessment, social networks, etc.
Simultaneously, =E2=80=9Cbig data=E2=80=9D, data mining, machine =
learning and Analytics technologies allow the exploitation and mining of =
increasingly large datasets. As a result, a new field of research, =
called Learning Analytics, has recently emerged. Learning Analytics is =
defined as =E2=80=9Cthe
measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners =
and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing =
learning and the environments in which it occurs=E2=80=9D (Long & =
Siemens, 2011)1.
The Universit=C3=A9 de Lorraine is involved in a big national project =
about digital transformation of higher education: the PIA 2 DUNE EOLE =
project2. One action of this project is dedicated to the development and =
deployment of Learning Analytics tools within the university.

The position
A postdoctoral position is offered in order to scientifically explore =
research questions related to these Learning Analytics tools, to manage =
the transition of students from secondary to tertiary studies, and to =
increase engagement and motivation of learners. The postdoctoral student =
will be in charge of designing new Machine Learning based models and to =
implement Learning Analytics tools. He will contribute to the progress =
of the technology, considering the expected application needs and =
performance. A specific attention will be put on the
transparency of the algorithms.

Requirements
The candidate should hold a PhD in Computer science, Artificial =
Intelligence, Data Science or Educational Sciences, with strong =
capabilities in computer science and data modelling.
The successful applicant should have a strong record in statistical =
machine learning and/or data mining. He should also have experience in a =
programming language and in one popular platform in the field, so as to =
design, develop and make the prototype evolve.
Solid background and skills:
- statistical machine learning, data mining, Java, R,
- able to work in a collaborative and multidisciplinary group, =
scientifically curious, rigorous, creative and able to develop an own =
research agenda,
- a first experience in Learning Analytics will be appreciated.
