Title
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Semantic ressource building based on specific concepts extracted from
collaborative productions such as forums or social networks

Context
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Collaborative tools such as forums or social networks now are also =
widely used
in organizations.  These organizations want to valorize their users'
produced texts.  In a context of novelty or innovation new vocabulary =
and new
expressions are used.  Our goal is first to detect the terms used in the =
textual
productions, then to filter the terms according to their novelty and =
finally to
organize these new terms in semantic resources.

Scientific objectives
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The starting point can be topic modelling methods such as LDA (Latent =
Dirichlet
Allocation) which are able to extract "concepts" from whole collections =
of
documents.  The topic modelling concepts are represented by vectors =
where each
word is weighted.  The "concepts" generated by LDA are not the terms (as
multiwords) such those found in semantic ressources (thesaurus, =
ontologies). So
the first objective will be the terminological extraction to discover =
these
multiword terms.

For collaborative productions in new fields, we will have then to detect =
the
novelty of the discovered terms. This can be done either by comparison =
of the
extracted set of terms with that discovered in a corpus of general =
documents
with the same method, or by comparison to terms of a known semantic =
ressource
(WordNet for example).

Finally we want to organize these new terms either by extending existing
semantic ressources or build new ones.

As the collaborative productions are dynamic, iterative process should =
also
be designed. This will also be a way to detect novelty.

The proposed research will be done in the Computer Science Department of =
the
Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne, as part of the Hubert Curien =
Laboratory.

The Computer Science Department is a part of the Henri Fayol Institute =
of the
Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne which is composed of 99 people, 46 are
permanents (41 teacher-researchers and 5 administrative and technical =
people)
and 53 PhD and post-PhD students.

The Hubert Curien Laboratory is the CNRS UMR 5516 with 130 researchers =
and
teacher-researchers who are permanent staff, 20 engineers and =
administrative
personnel, 90 PhD and post-PhD students. It is composed of two =
departments:
"Optics photonics and microwave" and "Computer science, telecom and =
image".

linguistics
with a programming experience. She or he should have a background in =
natural
language processing, text mining or information retrieval. The applicant =
should
also have programming skills in some programming languages, and will be =
