*WebNLG 20162nd International Workshop on Natural Language Generation and
the Semantic WebSeptember 6th, 2016. Edinburgh, UK.website:
http://webnlg2016.sciencesconf.org <http://webnlg2016.sciencesconf.org> *

*Colocated with INLG 2016 *
website: http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/INLG2016/index.html
INLG 2016 includes the main conference,  a tutorial on DeepLearning and NLG
tutorial on DeepLearning and NLG, a hackaton and two workshops.

Invited Speaker : Roberto Navigli, Sapienza, Universita di Roma, Italy
website: http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/

*Importants dates:*

Submissions due: June 1, 2016 (2 page abstract)
Notification: July 1, 2016
Final version due: July 29, 2016
Workshop: 6 September 2016

*Definition and scope:*

With the development of the Semantic Web technology and the advent of
Linked Data, the connection between Natural Language Generation (NLG) and
the Semantic Web (SW) is rapidly strengthening.

As Semantic Web applications are required to facilitate access to, and
presentation of, web data,  NLG-based approaches are often used to develop
Natural Language Interfaces (e.g., Quelo[1] and ORAKEL[2]) and ontology
verbalisers (e.g. SWAT[3], ACE[4], NaturalOWL[5][6], MIAKT[7]).

Furthermore, there are strong parallels between some of the current SW work
and the different steps involved in NLG. For instance, SW applications aim
at providing methods to facilitate the exploration of large datasets. From
the NLG point of view this can be viewed as  a content selection problem.
Similarly, because it relates text segments to data, work on entity linking
and open knowledge extraction is relevant for NLG lexicalisation while
pattern extraction has clear connections to the template extraction
techniques often resorted to in the surface realisation step of the NLG
process.

The goal of this workshop is to promote discussion and exchange of
research on NLG and the SW. The workshop invites the submission of
abstracts presenting work in progress, system demonstrations, a negative
result, an opinion piece, or a summary of research activities.

*Topics of interest:*

   - Ontology Summarization
   - Content Selection
   - Ontology Modularization
   - Content Planning
   - Fact Ranking
   - Exploration of SW data
   - Standards for lexicons
   - Ontology Lexicalisation
   - Open Knowledge Extraction: Relations, Events, Entity Linking
   - Semantic Annotation and Wikification
   - Lexicalisation, Template Extraction, Surface Realisation
   - LG applications from SW data
   - Ontology Verbalisation
   - Query Verbalisation
   - Entity Presentation
   - Answer Aggregation and Rendering
   - NLG based NL interfaces to KBs
   - Document Generation
   - Summarisation and SW data
   - eLearning
   - Feedback Generation

*Submission guidelines:*

Authors should submit anonymous abstracts which should not exceed two pages
in length (excluding data, figures and references). The final camera ready
version of the full paper for the proceedings should be no longer than 8
(eight) pages in total. The proceedings of the workshop will be uploaded to
the ACL anthology.

Reviewing will be blind and submission selection will be managed by an
international programme committee. Final decisions on the technical
programme will be made by the PC chairs.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors' names
and affiliations. Self-references that reveal the authors' identity, e.g.,
"We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use
citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".

The abstract must be submitted electronically in Adobe PDF format at
http://webnlg2016.sciencesconf.org/submission/submit

Submissions should follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings. The use
of the ACL style files is strongly recommended. Style files could be found
at
http://acl2016.org/index.php?article%20id=3D9
http://acl2016.org/files/acl2016.zip
