==============================================
In the era of Internet and web 2,0 technologies, social networks has 
attained thriving popularity. These networks build online communities 
and allow users to interact with each other by sharing their interests, 
playing games, organizing events or commenting on news stories, amongst 
other activities. In fact, the recent statistics indicate that active 
users of the social media are over 2.2 Billion. As most popular social 
networks, we motion the leader Facebook which is the first social 
network that surpasses 1 billion registered accounts, Twitter which has 
more than 316 million users, or whether the world's largest professional 
network LinkedIn which connects more than 300 million members. These 
creators of online communities collect all kinds of information 
describing the users' relationships, interests, apps in use, spending 
habits, and also religion or political opinions. However, the growth of 
social media, makes users requirements for trust, security and privacy a 
compelling task.

The Trust, Security, and Privacy in Social Networks track of the 13th 
IEEE International Conference on Advanced and Trusted Computing, 
provides a forum to present and discuss a new breed of methods in this 
highly challenging research field. The main topics, but not limited to, 
include:

•    Privacy and security in social systems
•    Trust and reputation schemes
•    Federation and identity management
•    Social implications of security and trust
•    Authentication and authorization models
•    Risk management and policy models
•    Anonymity in social networks
•    Semantics, metrics and models
•    Benchmarking, modeling and performance
•    Management of social network data
•    Detection and prevention of social misbehavior
