============================================================

                     IEEE DSAA'2016

                    Special Session
  EnGeoData - Environmental and Geo-spatial Data Analytics

                   Montreal, Canada
                  October 17-19, 2016

=============================================================

---- AIMS AND TOPICS

Environmental and more generally geo-spatial information is now provided 
by crowdsourcing but also by public administrations in the context of 
the open data policies. Analyses of such data are still challenging. 
Firstly because of their heterogeneity (structural, semantic, spatial 
and temporal), and secondly because of the difficulty in choosing the 
"best" knowledge discovery process to apply, according to the needs of 
the experts in the field. This special issue aims to provide high 
quality research covering all or part of the challenges mentioned above, 
from a theoretical or experimental point of view.

Challenge about data science deals with creation, storage, search, 
sharing, modeling, analysis, and visualization of data, information, and 
knowledge. In Data Science context, spatio-temporal aspects are crucial 
in order to manage and mine data, to index and retrieve information, and 
finally to discover and visualize knowledge. By taking into account 
these spatio-temporal aspects, original methods have to be proposed for 
processing real and complex data from different domains, e.g., 
environment, agriculture, health, urban, and so forth.

Topics:
- Pre and Post Data processing
- Data Quality, and Result Evaluation
- Data Mining or Data Warehousing Applications
- Text-Mining or Information Retrieval
- Visual Analytics
- KDD real use-cases dedicated to environmental and geo-spatial Data
