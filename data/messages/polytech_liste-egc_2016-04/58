2nd ACM-SIGIR workshop on Medical Information Retrieval

Call for Papers (2 & 4 pages)
**Extended submission deadline: May 16**
http://medir2016.imag.fr/

Medical information search refers to methodologies and technologies that
seek to improve access to medical information archives via a process of
information retrieval (IR). Such information is now potentially accessible
from many sources including the general web, social media, journal
articles, and hospital records.

Medical information is of interest to a wide variety of users, including
patients and their families, researchers, general practitioners and
clinicians, and practitioners with specific expertise such as radiologists.
Despite the popularity of the medical domain for users of search engines,
and current interest in this topic within the information retrieval
research community, development of search and access technologies remains
particularly challenging. One of the central issues in medical information
search is diversity of the users of these services. In particular, they
have varying categories of information needs, varying levels of medical
knowledge, and varying language skills. In addition, the format,
reliability, and quality of biomedical and medical information varies
greatly. A single health record can contain clinical notes, technical
pathology data, images, and patient-contributed histories, and may be
linked by a physician to research papers. The importance of health and
medical topics and their impact on people=E2=80=99s everyday lives makes th=
e need
for retrieval of accurate and reliable information especially important.
Determining the likely reliability of available information is challenging.
Finally, as with information retrieval in general, the evaluation of
medical search tools is vital and challenging. For example, there are no
established or standardized baselines or evaluation metrics, and limited
availability of test collections.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in medical
information search with the goal of identifying specific research
challenges that need to be addressed to advance the state-of-the-art and to
foster interdisciplinary collaborations towards the meeting of these
challenges. To enable this, we encourage participation from researchers in
all fields related to medical information search including mainstream
information retrieval, but also natural language processing, multilingual
text processing, and medical image analysis.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Users and information needs
- Semantics and NLP for medical IR
- Reliability and trust in medical IR
- Personalised search
- Evaluation of medical IR
- Multilingual issues in medical IR
- Multimedia technologies in medical IR
- The role of social media in medical IR
