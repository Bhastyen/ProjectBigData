Subject: [liste-egc] Stage Master2R : A data flux comparison among different
 Distributed Frequents Itemset Mining Algorithms over MapReduce platform

Object: Internship Master / Engineer

Place: Paris Area, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France

Subject: A data flux comparison among different Distributed Frequents 
Itemset Mining Algorithms over MapReduce platform

Period: 6 months internship from April/May to September/October 2015 - 
approx. 508€/month

Description: This internship subject deals with two research fields: 
Data Mining and Cloud Computing.

The objective of the internship is
(1) to implement or find the source code for the following Distributed 
Frequents Itemset Mining Algorithms over MapReduce platform :
MRApriori algorithm, IMRApriori algorithm, SPC and DPC algorithms, DPFPM 
algorithm, Mreclat algorithm,  and Apriori-V algorithm.
(2) to compare the mining performance, the quantity of data distributed 
in each data node before the mining work and the quantity of data 
communicated among each node in the mining work among these algorithms.
(3) to develop or find  the source code for a vertical data layout 
bitmap converter, if it is necessary, for the preparation of data sets 
in different experiences.
(4) to study and implement, if it's possible with the time constraint, 
some improvements for Apriori-V algorithm.

This internship will contribute in order to:
1. understand different waysof working of the main types of Distributed 
Frequents Itemset Mining Algorithms over MapReduce platform;
2. clarify the utilisations and the flux of different data types in 
Distributed Frequents Itemset Mining Algorithms over MapReduce platform;
3. plan our future development and improvements for our ongoing studies 
related to Apriori-V algorithm in this domain.

The internship is available immediately, will take place at the ETIS Lab 
(ENSEA / UCP / CNRS UMR 8051) located at Cergy Pontoise in the Paris 
area and will last for 6 months.
