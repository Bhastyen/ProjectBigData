OBJECTIVE: Machine learning for Cognitive Autonomic Networking in 5G

Thesis Location : Paris area
Research Lab: IRISA Rennes, France
Industrial partner: Nokia Bell Labs - Paris area, France

CONTEXT:

Some consensus exists on 5G technologies regarding =E2=80=9Cwhat they shall=
 be=E2=80=9D. 5G
is envisioned by the majority of Telecom actors as the next mobile network
generation which should be economically interesting and profit generator in
terms of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditure (OPEX) with
viable business models [1]. It shall also bring solutions to massive
customers described as =E2=80=9Cking=E2=80=9D, who are more and more demand=
ing for both
cost-efficient services as well as high satisfaction. To meet these
demands, the network autonomic mechanisms, named as =E2=80=9CAutonomic Netw=
orking=E2=80=9D,
are considered as good candidates to provide intelligent networking
solutions for 5G networks.

SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGES:

 The =E2=80=9CAutonomic Networking=E2=80=9D refers to the concept of self-m=
anagement
network capabilities (i.e. self-configuring/self-healing/self-optimization
without human intervention) that results in simplified network management
and thus in reduction of deployment and management costs of future 5G
networks [2, 3]. Furthermore, cognition (i.e. knowledge) associated with
network automation makes network intelligent. Therefore, autonomic
networking based on cognition may be seen as a powerful mechanism for
efficient and dynamic adaptation of the network in order to individually
meet the personalized demands of customers in terms of quality of
experience (QoE). To this end, customizing QoE delivered to customers is
essential for operators and/or service providers of 5G networks [4].

PhD THESIS OBJECTIVES:

 The objective of this thesis is to improve the self-organization and
autonomic networking approaches with the integration of machine learning
and data analytics. This approach based on machine learning and data
analysis will be used to customize the QoE for users through the
customization of Autonomic Networking. The candidate will have the task of
designing this customization tool that will permit the operator to obtain
rich knowledge and varied information on users as well as the network (from
the radio network and base operators/suppliers). The focus will be on
self-organizing/optimization mechanisms of 5G networks. To this end, the
candidate will explore how to organize and analyze large sets of data from
the network for extracting useful information and data. The candidate will
also study distributed coordination as well as learning algorithms required
to build the personalization templates/models for targeted networks
autonomic networking mechanisms.
The codes will be developed in Python / C ++ or other scripting languages.
 During this project, the candidate will develop his/her expertise in
distributed optimization, machine learning, big data, and radio and network
contextualization for 5G and self- organization/optimization mechanisms.

REQUIRED PROFILE:

 The ideal candidate should hold a Master degree in applied mathematics, or
related fields. She or he should have a background in machine learning,
statistics, distributed optimization, game theory, linear algebra and
signal processing. Knowledge in using machine learning tools is also
wished. The applicant should also be motivated by theoretical computations
and, comfortable and familiar with software development.

CIFRE CONTRACT WITH NOKIA:

The contract with Nokia will be for 36 months and salary will be between
28k=E2=82=AC et 32k=E2=82=AC depending on experience.
Work start date: as soon as possible (depending on the ANRT acceptance)
