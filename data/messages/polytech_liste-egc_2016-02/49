******************************************************Conference STC 2016
Paris, April 17-19, 2016 Call for
participations******************************************************

On behalf of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI), and
the French Medical Informatics Association (AIM), we invite you to the 15th
Special Topic Conference - STC2016 organized from April 17th to April 19th,
2016, in Paris


*Important Dates*

   - *Early bird registration: February 17th, 2016*
   - Conference : April 17-19, 2016

*Transforming Health Care with the Internet of Things*

The chosen theme of STC2016 is focusing on the transformation of modern
healthcare by the disruptive innovation of the Internet of Things (IoT). To
better understand the basic idea of the IoT, it is good to go back to Kevin
Ashton, who introduced the term for  the first time in 1999. He stated that
=E2=80=9CIn the real world, things matter more than ideas=E2=80=9D. His ori=
ginal idea was
that =E2=80=9CWe need to empower computers with their own means of gatherin=
g
information, so they can see, hear, and smell the world for themselves, in
all its random glory. RFID and sensor technology enable computers to
observe, identify, and understand the world=E2=80=94without the limitations=
 of
human-entered data.=E2=80=9D

The IoT has entered mostly unnoticed in the everyday life of modern
citizens, via their phone, watch, devices managing their home =E2=80=9Csyst=
ems=E2=80=9D,
their car and shopping cards, and many more little helpers. These
developments will change dramatically the relationship  between the
individual and the machine. It will have a great impact on the autonomy of
the citizen, especially in relation to the health and social care system.
The plea for an increasing role of the citizen in its responsibility for
its own health can now be supported by IoT.

IoT can provide the citizen a key role in the transition from the medical
curative model to a citizen-centered health system and a social
interconnected model focused on preventive medicine and
wellbeing preservation. The IoT can contribute to build communities of
informed and connected (e-)Patients that can interact in real time with
each other, and with health and social care providers. The IoT can be
the driver for the paradigm shift towards sustainable health and social
care systems. But as the concept of Caring Village of the Future states as
its main objective =E2=80=9Clinking IT with Empathy=E2=80=9D, there should =
be a balance
between the potential of the IoT and the values and priorities of the
patient and ethical values such as the respect of privacy and patient data
confidentiality which has to be managed in line with its introduction in
health care.

The STC2016 conference will deal with the convergence of a process
originally fuelled by technical and scientific forces, and the current
political forces driven by the sustainability agenda of health and social
care. This should emphasize the process to humanize the more and more
solitary individual although more and more connected and surrounded by the
IoT. Our ambition is to concentrate on this debate and create a platform
for these different dimensions of this unstoppable development.

STC2016 will create a focus on this special topic in a two-day long, one
session style conference, in which we look for a balanced program with
contributions combining fundamental, applied and industrial aspects of the
IoT in health.
