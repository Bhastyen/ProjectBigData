Call for Demonstrations

The 14th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC =
2016)
October 10-13, 2016, Banff, Alberta, Canada

The ICSOC Demonstration Track offers an exciting and highly interactive =
way to show research prototypes/work in service oriented computing (SOC) =
and related areas. Proposals for research prototype demos should focus =
on developments and innovation in the areas of service engineering, =
operations, cloud and big data services, implementation of services as =
well as development and adoption of services in specific organizations, =
businesses and the society at large.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Areas of interest for demonstrations include all topics of interest for =
the ICSOC conference. Specific topics of interest include but are not =
limited to:
* Modeling Business Services and Service Value Networks
* Flexible Service Composition and Mashups
* Business Process Interaction and Choreographies
* Business Intelligence and Analytics for Services
* Services on the Cloud (XAAS)
* Service Integration and Orchestration
* Service Engineering Tools and Methodology
* Service Design Methods and Tools
* Service Change Management Systems
* Service Operations and Management
* Service Applications and Implementations
* Service-oriented Architecture Showcases
* Quality of Service Design and Management
* Service Security, Privacy, and Trust
* Service Vocabularies and Ontology
* Cloud Computing Services and Engineering
* Grid and Scientific Computing Services
* Pervasive and Mobile Services
* Embedded and Real-time Services
* Testbeds for Service Technologies and Concepts
* Social Networks and Services
* Internet of Things Services
* Data-aware Services including Artifact-Centric Systems
* Services for Big Data
* Human-mediated Services
* RESTful Web Services
* Open API
* Service Adaptation and Customization
* Service Governance
* Formal Methods for Web Services
* Validation and Verification of Services
* Elastic Service Computing
* RFID, sensor data and services related to the Internet of Things
* Services related linked open data

DEMO SUBMISSION
Submissions have to include description of the contribution including =
title, system overview, summary of the significance and novel =
characteristics as well as functions/features to be demonstrated. =
Descriptions are to be written in English and must not exceed four (4) =
pages following LNCS format (see =
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html =
<http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html> for details). =
Additionally, authors may provide a link to a short online video or =
screen cast not exceeding 6 minutes in length (hard limit) of their =
demonstration. The video is recommended, not mandatory. The video must =
be playable using a wide variety of media players.=20

Submissions have to be submitted electronically, in PDF format, via the =
Demonstration Track in the conference submission system: 6. All demo =
submissions will be selected based on several criteria including the =
novelty, the maturity of the effort as well as the research =
contributions of the demonstration system. We are particularly =
interested in submissions that deal with new types of applications in =
SOC and relevant areas, which help motivate conference attendees to =
pursue similar efforts. Accepted papers will be included in the ICSOC =
2016 conference proceedings to be published by Springer.

At least one author is expected to register for and showcase the =
demonstration at the ICSOC 2016 conference in Banff, Alberta, Canada.
