Description and Objectives
---------------------------

In the world of the Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid growth and exponent=
ial use of digital components leads to the emergence of intelligent environ=
ments namely "digital ecosystems" connected to the web and composed of mult=
iple and independent entities such as individuals, organizations, services,=
 software and applications sharing one or several missions and focusing on =
the interactions and inter-relationships among them=2E With the help of the=
 computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-=
* properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration)=
 environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its "digital c=
omponents", in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserv=
ed, managed and used=2E The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehen=
d big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties pla=
tforms=2E

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly=
 complex to study and design=2E This also leads to a poor understanding as =
to how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative,=
 intelligent and value-creating=2E The application of Information Technolog=
ies has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request r=
esources and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impac=
ting business practices and knowledge=2E These technologies can be improved=
 through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big =
data management, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer int=
eractions, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems =
to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resourc=
es=2E

The International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES),pr=
eviously named "The International Conference on Management of Emergent Digi=
tal EcoSystems", aims to develop and bring together a diverse community fro=
m academia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the =
manifold challenges and issues related to resource management of Digital Ec=
osystems and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and ada=
pted to this end=2E

MEDES 2016 calls for full papers presenting interesting recent results or n=
ovel ideas in all areas of Emergent Digital EcoSystems=2E  At the same time=
, the conference calls  for short papers presenting interesting and excitin=
g recent results or novel thought-provoking ideas that are not quite ready,=
 and preferably include a system demonstration=2E=20


Topics=20
-------
MEDES 2016 seeks contributions in the following areas:

Paper Submission
----------------

Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploa=
ded using the conference website=2E The submitted paper should be at most 8=
 ACM single-space printed pages=2E Papers that fail to comply with length l=
imit will be rejected=2E=20

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers=2E After the=
 preliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all=
 reviewer inquiries and their comments=2E Based on the rebuttal feedback, r=
eviewers notify authors with the final decision=2E Selection criteria will =
include: relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness,=
 and quality of presentation=2E Preference will be given to submissions tha=
t take strong or challenging positions on important emergent topics related=
 to Digital Ecosystems=2E At least one author should attend the conference =
to present the paper=2E=20

The conference Proceedings will be published by ACM and indexed by the ACM =
Digital Library and DBLP=2E
