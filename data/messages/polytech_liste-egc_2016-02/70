Subject: [liste-egc] CFP: Joint workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP
 for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL) @JCDL2016

=3D=3D Call for Papers =3D=3D

You are invited to participate in the upcoming Joint workshop on =
Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL), to be =
held as part of the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2016 (JCDL =
2016) in Newark, New Jersey, USA.=20
=20
http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/birndl-jcdl2016/
=20
We are happy to announce that the past BIR and NLPIR4DL organizers are =
proposing this workshop at JCDL together. In conjunction with the =
workshop, we will hold the 2nd CL-SciSumm Shared Task in Scientific =
Document Summarization.  http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/cl-scisumm2016/=20
Reports from the shared task systems will be featured as part of a =
session at the workshop.=20

=3D=3D=3D Important Dates =3D=3D=3D

- Submissions: 15 April 2016
- Notification: 06 May 2016
- Camera Ready Contributions: 03 June 2016
- Workshop: 23 June 2016 in Newark, New Jersey, USA

=3D=3D=3D Aim of the Workshop =3D=3D=3D

Current digital libraries collect and allow access to digital papers and =
their metadata (including citations), but mostly do not analyze the =
items they index. The large scale of scholarly publications poses a =
challenge for scholars in their search for relevant literature. =
Searchers of digital libraries, citation indices and journal databases =
are inundated with thousands of results. The community needs to develop =
techniques to better support both basic as well as higher-order =
information seeking and scholarly sensemaking activities.
=20
The BIRNDL 2016 workshop is a joint scientific event gathering scholars =
from the BIR (Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval) and the =
NLPIR4DL (Text and citation analysis for scholarly digital libraries) =
communities. The scope of BIRNDL is on scholarly publications and data - =
the explosion in the production of scientific literature and the growth =
of scientific enterprise; its consistent exponential growth approaches =
an empirical law. The workshop will investigate how natural language =
processing, information retrieval, scientometric and recommendation =
techniques can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document =
understanding, analysis and retrieval at scale. Researchers are in need =
of assistive technologies to track developments in an area, identify the =
approaches used to solve a research problem over time and summarize =
research trends. Digital libraries require semantic search, =
question-answering and automated recommendation and reviewing systems to =
manage and retrieve answers from scholarly databases. Full document text =
analysis can help to design semantic search, translation and =
summarization systems; citation and social network analyses can help =
digital libraries to visualize scientific trends, bibliometrics and =
relationships and influences of works and authors. All these approaches =
can be supplemented with the metadata supplied by digital libraries, =
inclusive of usage data, such as download counts.
=20
This workshop will be relevant to scholars in the cross-disciplinary =
field of Computer Science and Digital Libraries, in particular in the =
research areas of Natural Language Processing and in Information =
Retrieval; it will also be important for all stakeholders in the =
publication pipeline: implementers, publishers and policymakers. Even =
when only considering the scholarly sites within Computer Science, we =
find that the field is well-represented - ACM Portal, IEEE Xplore, =
Google Scholar, PSU's CiteSeerX, MSR's Academic Search, Elsevier=E2=80=99s=
 Mendeley, Tsinghua's ArnetMiner, Trier's DBLP, Hiroshima's PRESRI; with =
this workshop we hope to bring a number of these contributors together. =
Today's publishers continue to seek new ways to be relevant to their =
consumers, in disseminating the right published works to their audience. =
The fact that formal citation metrics have become an increasingly large =
factor in decision-making by universities and funding bodies worldwide =
makes the need for research in such topics and for better methods for =
measuring the impact of work more pressing.
=20
This workshop is also informed by an ongoing COST Action TD1210 =
KnowEscape. http://www.knowescape.org
=20
=3D=3D=3D Workshop Topics =3D=3D=3D

To support the previously described goals the workshop topics include =
(but are not limited to) the following:
- Information retrieval (IR) for digital libraries and scientific =
information portals
- IR for scholarly text, e.g. citation-based IR
- IR for scientific domains, e.g. social sciences, life sciences etc.
- Information Seeking Behaviour
- Navigation, searching and browsing in scholarly DLs; Niche search in =
scholarly DLs; New information access methods for scientific papers
- Query expansion and relevance feedback approaches
- Question-answering for scholarly DLs
- Recommendations based on explicit and implicit user feedback
- Recommendation for scholarly papers, reviewers, citations and =
publication venues
- (Social) Book Search
- Summarisation of scientific articles; Automatic creation of reviews =
and automatic qualitative assessment of submissions;
- Bibliometrics, citation analysis and network analysis for IR; Citation =
function/motivation analysis; Novel bibliographic metrics; Topical =
modeling analysis
- Knowledge discovery and analysis of the ancestry of ideas
- Metadata and controlled vocabularies for resource description and =
discovery; Automatic metadata discovery, such as language identification
- Translation, multilingual and multimedia analysis and alignment of =
scholarly works
- Analyses of writing style in scholarly publications
- Science Modelling (both formal and empirical)
- Task based user modelling, interaction, and personalisation
- (Long-term) Evaluation methods and test collection design
- Collaborative information handling and information sharing
- Disambiguation issues in scholarly DLs using NLP or IR techniques; =
Data cleaning and data quality
- Classification, categorisation and clustering approaches
- Information extraction (including topic detection, entity and relation =
extraction)
=20
For the paper sessions we invite descriptions of running projects and =
ongoing work as well as contributions from industry. Papers that =
investigate multiple themes directly are especially welcome.
=20
=3D=3D=3D Submission Details =3D=3D=3D
All submissions must be written in English following Springer LNCS =
author guidelines (max. 6 pages for short and 12 pages for full papers, =
Springer LNCS: http://www.springer.com/lncs; exclusive of unlimited =
pages for references) and should be submitted as PDF files to EasyChair. =
All submissions will be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. =
Please be aware of the fact that at least one author per paper needs to =
register for the workshop and attend the workshop to present the work. =
In case of no-show the paper (even if accepted) will be deleted from the =
proceedings and from the program.
=20
EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dbirndl2016
=20
Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop =
proceedings publication service (ISSN 1613-0073) and in the ACL =
Anthology. This way the proceedings will be permanently available and =
citable (digital persistent identifiers and long term preservation).
