**********************


The goal of this track is to bring together researchers and practitioners
both from the Academia and from the Industry working in the areas of
Service-oriented and component-based software applications and
architectures and addressing adaptation and reconfiguration issues.
Different investigation topics are involved, such as: CBSE, SOA, Functional
and Non Functional (NF) requirements (QoS, performance, resilience),
monitoring, diagnosis, decision and execution of adaptation and
reconfiguration. Different research axes are covered: concepts, methods,
techniques, and tools to design, develop, deploy and manage adaptive and
reconfigurable software systems.

The development of composite services poses very interesting challenges
concerning their functional and NF requirements. On the one hand, a
composite software system depends on the NF requirements of its
constituting components in order to provide a satisfactory service to the
user. On the other hand, the main issues for the fulfillment of QoS and
service level agreements (SLA) are concerned with performance variability.
Indeed, the QoS may evolve frequently, either because of internal changes
or because of workload fluctuations. The performance and the robustness of
the composite software system may be significantly improved by monitoring
the execution of the components and by flexibly reacting to degradation and
anomalies in a timely fashion.

The concept of adaptive and reconfigurable software systems has been
introduced in order to describe architectures which exhibit such
properties. An adaptive and reconfigurable software system can repair
itself if any execution problems occur, in order to successfully complete
its own execution, while respecting functional and NF agreements. In the
design of an adaptive and reconfigurable software system, several aspects
have to be considered. For instance, the system should be able to predict
or to detect degradations and failures as soon as possible and to enact
suitable recovery actions. Moreover, different NF requirements service
levels might be considered in order to complete the execution in case of
failure.

TOPICS
For this track, contributions are devoted to functional and non functional
adaptability and reconfiguration management in service-oriented and
component-based software systems. Specifically, the relevant topics
include, but are not limited to:
- Distributed and centralized collaborative solutions for the diagnosis and
repair of software systems
- Design for the diagnosability and repairability
- Collaborative Management of NF requirements (quality, security,
robustness, availability)
- Monitoring simple and composite architectures, components and services
- Semantic (or analytic) architectural and behavioral models for monitoring
of software systems
- Dynamic reconfiguration of CB and SO architectures
- Collaborative planning and decision making
- Collaborative technologies for ensuring autonomic properties
- Predictive management of adaptability.
- Collaborative Management of autonomic properties
- Experiences in practical adaptive and reconfigurable CB and SO
applications
- Tools and prototypes for managing adaptability of CB and SO applications
