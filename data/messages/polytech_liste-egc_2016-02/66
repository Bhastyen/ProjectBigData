Subject: [liste-egc] PAN 2016: Call for Participation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAN 2016: Call for Participation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We invite you to take part in one of the following shared tasks 
(training dataset are already available):

1. Author Identification -- Given a document, who wrote it?
This task focuses on author clustering and author diarization. Both 
tasks are
concerned with measuring author similarity across and within texts.

2. Author Profiling -- Given a document, what're its author's traits?
This task is concerned with predicting an author's demographics from her
writing. For example, an author's style may reveal her age and gender.
The focus is on cross-genre: i.e., the training documents will be on one 
genre (e.g. Twitter)
and the evaluation will be on another genre (e.g. blogs, social 
media...).

3. Author Obfuscation -- Given a document, hide its author.
This task works against identification and profiling by automatically
paraphrasing a text to obfuscate its author's style. The tasks offered 
are
author masking and obfuscation evaluation.

PAN is held in conjunction with the CLEF'16 conference in Evora, 
Portugal.
