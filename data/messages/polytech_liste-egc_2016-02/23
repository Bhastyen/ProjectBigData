WORKSHOP ON SOCIAL BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE (SocBI)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
associated with the 20th East-European Conference on Advances in 
Databases
and Information Systems (ADBIS)

http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/events/SocBI.html

August 28, 2016
Prague, Czech Republic

SUBJECT AREA DESCRIPTION AND MOTIVATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some statistical estimations reveal that the number of social media 
users will
reach more than 2  billion by 2018. Consequently, "the social media 
analytics
market will grow to $2.73 billion in 2019"
(http://www.business2community.com/social-media/social-media-analytics-going-evolve-
2015-01099021#ekIbYOdOBJMvOJii.97).

Social media generate a substantial amount of data, including among 
others:
short and long texts, images, sounds, videos, and geographical data.
Generally, these data are either unstructured or semi-structured and
their volume grows at a very fast rate. Social data become then a 
substantial
part of the Big Data pie.

Potentially, social data constitute a vault information for multiple 
application
domains. The most important ones include sales and marketing as well as 
security.
The main problems in getting the information from the vault are: (1) how 
to
efficiently analyze unstructured or semi-structured data, (2) how to 
efficiently
analyze huge data volumes that grow fast, and (3) how to visualize the 
results
of analyses. Some answers to these questions come with the so-called 
Social
Business Intelligence (SBI).

SBI focuses on social media analytics in a way traditional data are 
analyzed by
the Business Intelligence technologies. Thus, the research and 
technological efforts
in SBI focus on providing means for seeing social data as cube-like and 
for processing
cubes by means of OLAP-like applications. The most typical applications 
for social
data analysis include: opinion mining, customer classification, churn 
analysis, social
network analytics, thread detection (e.g, malware and hacker attacks), 
and forecasting.

Some of the challenges that still need to be solved include: (1) 
techniques for
modeling social data in a way suitable for analytical processing, 
including KPIs,
(2) techniques and tools for collecting fast growing and rapidly 
changing social data,
(3) assuring a high quality of data, (4) architectures, tools, and 
techniques for
efficient analysis of social data, (5) algorithms for predictive and 
prescriptive
analytics, (6) architectures for making social BI available not only for 
large but also
for small companies.

Despite the fact, that SBI becomes a hot research and technological 
topic and despite
the fact that some research, prototype, and commercial solutions (e.g., 
http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/business/social-insight.html) have 
been already
provided, there exist multiple open research and technological issues. 
Most of them
were reflected in the list of this workshop topics of interest.

MAJOR TOPICS OF INTEREST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- techniques and architectures for integrating social data sources
- requirements engineering for social BI
- social data modeling for analytics
- data models and query languages for social data
- social data quality metrics, measurement, and assurance
- KPIs, user interfaces, and visualization techniques
- frameworks and architectures for social analytics
- tools and techniques for handling historical social data
- algorithms, tools, and techniques for social data analysis
- algorithms, tools, and techniques for forecasting
- self-service and social BI automation

PUBLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A volume with workshop papers will be published by Springer in the 
Advances in
Intelligent Systems and Computing (AISC) series 
(http://www.springer.com/series/11156).

The authors of the best workshop papers will be invited to prepare 
extended versions
of their papers after the workshop. Following an additional round of 
reviews, the
extended papers  will appear in a special issue of Information System 
Frontiers,
Springer.

Each paper will be reviewed by at least two Program Committee members. 
Duplicate
submissions are NOT allowed, i.e. submitted papers must not overlap 
substantially with
any other papers of the same authors submitted elsewhere.

PAPER LENGTH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Camera-ready papers are to be prepared in LaTeX (detailed instructions 
will be
provided). The length of papers must not exceed 12 pages of the AISC 
format (see
Instructions for Authors at Springer Website - Word/Latex Template).

SUBMISSION DEADLINES
