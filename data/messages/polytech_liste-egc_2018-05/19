CONTEXT & OBJECTIVES

In the era of Big Data, every single user of our hyper-connected world leav=
es behind a myriad of digital breadcrumbs while performing her daily activi=
ties. Nowadays, a simple smartphone enables each one of us to browse the We=
b, listen to music on online musical services, post messages on social netw=
orks, perform online shopping, acquire images and record our geographical l=
ocations. This enormous amount of personal data can be exploited to improve=
 the lifestyle of each individual by extracting, analyzing and exploiting u=
ser's behavioral patterns like the items frequently purchased, the routinar=
y movements, the favorite sequence of songs listened, etc. Up to now, the h=
ighly valuable personal patterns able to predict human behavior can only be=
 extracted by big companies, which employ this information mainly to improv=
e marketing strategies. This organization-centric model does not empower to=
 take full advantage of the possibility of knowledge extraction offered by =
personal data, mainly because each company has only a limited view on indiv=
iduals that is restricted to the type of data for which the company provide=
s services. Moreover, users have a very limited capability to control and e=
xploit their personal data. Although some user-centric models like the Pers=
onal Information Management System and the Personal Data Store are emerging=
, currently there is still a significant lack in terms of algorithms and mo=
dels specifically designed to capture the knowledge from individual data an=
d to ensure privacy protection in a user-centric scenario.

Personal data analytics and individual privacy protection are the key eleme=
nts to leverage nowadays services to a new type of systems. The availabilit=
y of personal analytics tools able to extract hidden knowledge from individ=
ual data while protecting the privacy right can help the society to move fr=
om organization-centric systems to user-centric systems, where the user is =
the owner of her personal data and is able to manage, understand, exploit, =
control and share her own data and the knowledge deliverable from them in a=
 completely safe way.=20

The purpose of PAP, Personal Analytics and Privacy, is to encourage princip=
led research that will lead to the advancement of personal data analytics, =
personal services development, privacy, data protection and privacy risk as=
sessment. The workshop will seek top-quality submissions addressing importa=
nt issues related to personal analytics, personal data mining and privacy i=
n the context where real individual data (spatio-temporal data, call detail=
s records, tweets, mobility data, transactional data, social networking dat=
a, etc.) are used for developing a data-driven service, for realizing a soc=
ial study aimed at understanding nowadays society, and for publication purp=
oses. Papers can present research results in any of the themes of interest =
for the workshop as well as application experiences, tools and promising pr=
eliminary ideas. However, papers dealing with synergistic approaches that i=
ntegrate privacy requirements and protection in the personal data analytics=
 approach are especially welcome.

TOPICS

Authors are invited to submit original research or position papers proposin=
g novel methods or analyzing existing techniques on novel datasets on any  =
relevant topic. These can either be normal or short papers. Short papers ca=
n discuss new ideas which are at an early stage of development and which ha=
ve not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Topics of interest to the workshop in=
clude, but are not limited to, the following:

- Personal model summarizing the user's behaviors
- Personal data and knowledge management (databases, software, formats)
- Personal data collection (crawling, storage, compression)
- Personal data integration
- Personal Data Store and Personal Information Management Systems models
- Parameter-free and auto-adaptive methodologies for personal analytics
- Novel indicators measuring personal behavior
- Individual vs. collective models
- Privacy-preserving mining algorithm
- Privacy-preserving individual data sharing
- Privacy risk assessment
- Privacy and anonymity in collective services
- Information (data/patterns) hiding
- Privacy in pervasive/ubiquitous systems
- Security and privacy metrics
- Personal data protection and law enforcement
- Balancing privacy and quality of the service/analysis
- Case study analysis and experiments on real individual data


SUBMISSION & PUBLICATION

All contributions will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program=
 Committee. As regards size, contributions can be up to 16 pages in LNCS fo=
rmat, i.e., the ECML PKDD 2018 submission format. All papers should be writ=
ten in English and be in LNCS format. The following kinds of submissions wi=
ll be considered: research papers, tool papers, case study papers and posit=
ion papers. Detailed information on the submission procedure are available =
at the workshop web page:=20

http://kdd.di.unito.it/pap2018/.=20

Accepted papers will be published after the workshop by Springer in a volum=
e of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Condition for inclusion in t=
he post-proceedings is that at least one of the co-authors has presented th=
e paper at the workshop. Pre-proceedings will be available online before th=
e workshop.=20
