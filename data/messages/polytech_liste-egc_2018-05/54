-- FCA4AI (Sixth Edition) -- 
``What can FCA do for Artificial Intelligence?'' 
co-located with IJCAI 2018, Stockholm, Sweden

General Information. 

The five preceding editions of the FCA4AI Workshop (ECAI 2016, 2014 and 2012, IJCAI 2015 and 2013) showed that many researchers working in Artificial Intelligence are indeed interested in a powerful method for classification and mining such as Formal Concept Analysis (see CEUR Proceedings Vol-1703, Vol-1430, Vol-1257, Vol-1058, and Vol-939). 
This year, we have the chance to organize a new edition of the workshop in Stockholm co-located with the IJCAI 2018 Conference. 

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematically well-founded theory aimed at data analysis and classification. FCA allows one to build a concept lattice and a system of dependencies (implications) which can be used for many AI needs, e.g. knowledge processing, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning, ontology engineering, as well as information retrieval, recommendation, social network analysis and text processing. Thus, there exist many ``natural links'' between FCA and AI. 

Recent years have been witnessing increased scientific activity around FCA, in particular a strand of work emerged that is aimed at extending the possibilities of FCA w.r.t. knowledge processing, such as work on pattern structures and relational concept analysis. These extensions are aimed at allowing FCA to deal with more complex than just binary data, for solving problems in data analysis, knowledge discovery, knowledge representation, ontology engineering, and many more. 
All these works extend the capabilities of FCA and offer new possibilities for AI activities in the framework of FCA. 

Accordingly, in this workshop, we will be interested in the following main issues: 

- How can FCA support AI activities such as knowledge processing (knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and reasoning), 
learning (clustering, pattern and data mining), natural language 
processing, or information retrieval? 
- How can FCA be extended in order to help AI researchers to solve new 
and complex problems in their domain? 

The workshop is dedicated to discussing such issues. 

TOPICS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to: 

- Concept lattices and related structures: description logics, pattern structures, relational structures. 
- Knowledge discovery and data mining with FCA: association rules, itemsets and data dependencies, attribute implications, data pre-processing, redundancy and dimensionality reduction, classification and clustering. 
- Knowledge engineering and ontology engineering: knowledge representation and reasoning. 
- Scalable algorithms for concept lattices and artificial intelligence ``in the large'' (distributed aspects, big data). 
- Applications of concept lattices: semantic web, information retrieval, visualization and navigation, pattern recognition, and practical applications in agronomy, biology, chemistry, finance, manufacturing, medicine, etc. 

The workshop will include time for audience discussion toward developing a better understanding of the issues, challenges, and ideas being presented. 

IMPORTANT DATES: 

Submission deadline: June 4th 2018 
Notification to authors: June 21 2018 
Final version: July 1 2018 
Workshop: July 13 2018 

SUBMISSION DETAILS: 

The workshop welcomes submissions in pdf format in Springer's LNCS style. 
Submissions can be:
