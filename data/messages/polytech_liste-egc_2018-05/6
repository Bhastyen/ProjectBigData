# Call for Workshops and Tutorials

Conference website: http://iot-conference.org/iot2018
Deadline: May 15th, 2018.
Submission form: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diot2018wt

## Call for Workshops
(scroll down for the call for Tutorials)

Workshops collocated with the 8th International Conference on the Internet
of Things (IoT 2018) are opportunities to strengthen communities of
researchers and practitioners working in specific topics related to the
IoT. These events foster the exchange of new ideas, ongoing work, and
latests results, in established or emerging sub-domains of interest. They
are opportunities for IoT pioneers and practitioners in industry to share
hands-on experience with IoT systems (use cases, deployments,
architectures, etc.), and for researchers to present and receive feedback
on early research result.

We invite submission of half-day workshop proposals, with a clearly defined
scope that falls in the general topics of the conference. We also encourage
the submission of workshops that follow alternative formats such as
hackathons, plugfests, demo jams, or breakout sessions.


### Review Criteria for Workshop proposals

A limited number of workshop proposals will be accepted to IoT 2018. Each
proposal will be evaluated based on the quality of the proposal, and its
appeal to the IoT community. In particular, the proposals should
demonstrate the following:

- the workshops topics fall in the general scope of IoT2018
- there is a clear identity and a focus on a specific problem or technology
- there is an existing community of researchers and practitioners that are
susceptible to contribute to this event
- the organization and format are appealing for potential contributors and
participants

In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the Workshop Chairs may contact
the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. The
organisers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own
reviewing process and publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for
papers).


### How to submit a Workshop proposal

Submissions should be submitted no later than May 15th 2018 via EasyChair (
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diot2018wt ) as a 200 words
abstract, along with a single PDF file of 4 pages maximum, containing the
following section:

- Title, acronym, potentially logo
- Topics of interest covered by the workshop
- Motivation: Why is the topic of particular interest to a reasonable
fraction of the  IoT community? If applicable, a brief discussion of the
workshop=E2=80=99s history (experiences, number of submissions and attendee=
s,
etc.).
- Organization and Format: Description of the intended organization,
selection process for the contributors, and schedule of the event.
- Community: Evidence that there is an existing community of researchers
and practitioners that are susceptible to contribute to this event.
References to work relating to the core topic of the workshop that are not
only co-authored by the organizers.
- Chairs: Name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short biography of
each chair, explaining the chair=E2=80=99s expertise for the workshop
- Program Committee: Names and affiliations of potential PC members, half
of the potential PC members should have confirmed at the time of submission=
.

All workshop participants will be required to register for the full
conference as well. Workshop organizers will receive one complimentary
conference ticket for one organizer or one workshop participant. At the
discretion of the chairs, workshops may be cancelled if organisers have not
registered in a timely manner or if a workshop has received too few
submissions.


## Call for Tutorials

Tutorials collocated with the *8th International Conference on the Internet
of Things (IoT 2018)* are opportunities for IoT researchers and
practitioners to learn about models or technologies, providing practical
solutions for specific problems related to the IoT.

We invite submission of half-day tutorial proposals, with a clearly defined
topic that falls in the general scope of the conference.


### Review Criteria for Tutorial proposals

A limited number of tutorial proposals will be accepted to IoT 2018. Each
proposal will be evaluated based on the quality of the proposal, and its
appeal to the IoT community. In particular, the proposals should
demonstrate the following:

- the tutorial topics fall in the general scope of IoT2018
- there is a clear focus on a specific problem or technology
- there is a sufficiently large community interested in the topic

We expect tutorials to have practical parts in terms of examples or
preferably hands-on sessions. The organisers of accepted workshops will be
responsible for their own publicity (e.g., website, call for
participation).

### How to submit a Tutorial proposal

Submissions should be submitted no later than May 15th 2018 via EasyChair (
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diot2018wt ) as a 200 words
abstract, along with a single PDF file of 4 pages maximum, containing the
following section:

- Title, acronym, potentially logo
- Model or technology covered by the tutorial
- Motivation: Why is it of particular interest for the IoT community to
learn about this model or technology? A brief discussion of the
model/technology development history (previous tutorials, conferences where
it has been presented or demonstrated, community behind its development,
etc.).
- Detailed Description: content and schedule, description of learning
outcomes, presentation style, tutorial format, prior knowledge required by
the attendees.
- Tutorial Material: if applicable, description of the hardware and
software used for the tutorial. Will the software be openly accessible to
the participants? With what licence? If applicable, will the slides be
shared with the audience, with what licence?
- Audience: Evidence that there is an existing community of researchers and
practitioners that are susceptible to participate to this event.
- Presenters: Name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short
biography of each presenter, explaining their expertise in the tutorial
topic as well as their experiences in teaching and in tutorial presentation
- Requirements: Audio-visual or technical requirements and any special room
requirements.

All tutorial participants will be required to register for the full
conference as well. Tutorial organizers will receive one complimentary
conference ticket for one organizer or one tutorial participant. At the
discretion of the chairs, tutorials may be cancelled if organisers have not
registered in a timely manner.
