9th International Semantic Sensor Networks Workshop (SSN 2018)

Monterey, California, 9th October 2018

WWW: https://ssn2018.github.io/
E-mail: iswc-ssn2018@easychair.org

We would like to invite you cordially to consider contributing a paper to
SSN 2018 - held as a part of the 17th International Semantic Web Conference
(ISWC 2018).

Rapid growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) means that connected sensors
and actuators will be inundating the Web infrastructure with data.
Semantics is increasingly seen as a key enabler for integration of sensor
data and the broader Web ecosystem. The W3C and the Open Geospatial
Consortium standardisation bodies have taken a second look at the Semantic
Sensor Network ontology and have published a new standard ontology for
representing Sensors, Observations, Sampling, Actuation and Sensor
Networks. Analytical and reasoning capabilities afforded by Semantic Web
standards and technologies are considered important for developing advanced
applications that go from capturing observations to recognition of events,
deeper insights and actions. Furthermore, the contribution of semantics to
sensing and actuation patterns is currently being explored. Major
industries including manufacturing, transport and logistics, personal and
public health, smart cities and smart energy, crisis management and many
others are spanning commercial, civic, and scientific operations that
involve sensors, web, services and semantics. This workshop will continue
the activity started within ISWC in 2006, and complemented by special
tracks at ESWC since 2010. This 2018 edition benefits from renewed energy
arising from the October 2017 W3C recommendation and OGC standard and, more
importantly, increases significance due to the growth of IoT-enabled
applications.

The SSN workshop will be a half-day event that revives and strengthens the
community around the ontological representation of sensor and actuation
data and welcomes researchers from related communities. It will be highly
interactive, so as to facilitate discussions among participants that could
result in future collaborative work. An invited talk will be followed by
authors presenting research papers in either long or short format, together
with demonstrations that have been a successful feature of SSN in the past.
Sufficient time will be dedicated to questions and answers for each paper.
The session will end with a general discussion on experience with relevant
ontologies and ideas for next steps.
