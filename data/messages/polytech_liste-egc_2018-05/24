From Open Data to Linked Open Data for geospatial and spatio-temporal data:
semanticising metropolitan open data platforms

*Context*

The open data platform of Lyon Metropole (https://data.grandlyon.com/)
publishes a large amount of open data, allowing data re-users to develop
applications and innovative services. However, reusing data sets can be
sometimes difficult: each data set uses its own business-specific
"vocabulary", particular to the context in which it was generated, which
limits its understanding. This heterogeneity becomes even more problematic
when multiple data sets must be integrated or when a foreign audience wants
to grasp the information heritage of a metropolitan area.

Technologies and standards from the Web of data specifically aim at solving
this type of issues. They especially offer a resource description framework
(RDF), allowing interconnecting said resources, to make more explicit their
semantics by the use of ontologies.

Models and technologies also exist to semanticise data sets by
automatically transforming the data. Nonetheless, writing adapted
transformations, finding or reusing pieces of transformations, utilising
transformations at the scale of open data platforms, are still very
difficult scientific tasks that must be addressed. In particular,
geospatial and spatio-temporal data constitute the majority of data
available on Lyon's open data platform, and more generally urban open data
platforms. This type of data contains patterns and similarities that could
be exploited to simplifly semanticization.

Researchers at =C3=89cole des Mines de Saint-=C3=89tienne develop a service=
-based
platform for solving problems related to spatio-temporal data, called
Territoire (http://territoire.emse.fr), that also suffers from the same
issues regarding the heterogeneity of data sets. The platform is composed
of heteregenous services consuming data sets to perform tasks, and could
therefore benefit from the semanticization of data. A host of models and
tools were proposed to tackle these problems: SPARQL-Generate allowing to
generate RDF from documents in heretogeneous formats (
http://ci.emse.fr/sparql-generate); UCUM Datatypes allowing to represent
dimensionful values using custom datatypes (http://ci.emse.fr/lindt/); the
ETSI standard SAREF-SEAS ontology meant to represent engineering-related
knowledge.

*Objectives*

At the IT department of Lyon Metropole, the main goal is to make the open
data platform evolve towards a linked data and semantic web system in order
to facilitate their reusing, make the data more understandable and
processable, and such that data from other sources in standardised semantic
web formats can be interlinked.

The hired student at Lyon Metropole will have to: (1) Choose or develop
target knowledge models towards which data from the open data plateform
should be semanticised; (2) Contribute to evolving the workflow for
collecting, curating, processing, annotating, and deploying data, taking
into account semantic interoperability and data linkage; (3) Apply his/her
research results to improve the way open data are currently provided on the
platform.

*Working environment*
The PhD candidate will work part time at Lyon Metropole, and part time at
=C3=89cole des Mines de Saint-=C3=89tienne and the Laboratoire Hubert Curie=
n
(University of Saint-=C3=89tienne,
https://laboratoirehubertcurien.univ-st-etienne.fr) in the Connected
Intelligence team.

*Funding*
The CIFRE fellow signs a 3 years full time work contract with Lyon
Metropole, the gross annual salary will depend on the candidate: gross
annual salary of =E2=82=AC 23,484.

*Profile of the candidate*
The candidate should have a master degree or equivalent in computer
science, with strong background in Semantic Web and Web of data. The
candidate should also be a good developer, have a very good level (written
and oral) in English, good communication skills (oral and written), be
autonomous, and show motivation for research.

*Application instructions*
Applications must be composed of a Resume, Cover Letter in English, last
grade certificate, Recommendation Letters, and any other relevant document,
and must be sent in a compressed archive to:

Alessandro Cerioni <acerioni@grandlyon.com>, Antoine Zimmermann <
antoine.zimmermann@emse.fr>, Maxime Lefran=C3=A7ois, <maxime.lefrancois@ems=
e.fr>

- The application is opened until filled.
- Once the candidate is selected, the final decision will be made by the
French Cifre fellowship program two month later
- The PhD thesis is expected to start Q4 2018.
