Subject: [liste-egc] Interactive Adaptive Learning workshop at ECML PKDD
 2018


We organize a workshop to be held at ECML PKDD 2018 on
September 10, 2018 in Dublin (Ireland)

   Interactive Adaptive Learning
   link :  http://www.uni-kassel.de/go/ial2018

The workshop aims at discussing techniques and approaches for optimising 
the whole learning process, including the interaction with human 
supervisors, processing systems, and includes adaptive, active, 
semi-supervised, and transfer learning techniques, and combinations 
thereof in interactive and adaptive machine learning systems. Our 
objective is to bridge the communities researching and developing these 
techniques and systems in machine learning and data mining. Therefore, 
we welcome contributions that present a novel problem setting, propose a 
novel approach, or report experience with the practical deployment of 
such a system and raise unsolved questions to the research community.

In particular, we welcome contributions that address aspects including, 
but not limited to:

(*) Novel Techniques for Active, Semi-Supervised, Transfer Learning
     - methods for big, evolving, or streaming data,
     - methods for recent complex model structures such as DL neural 
networks
     - methods for interacting with imperfect or multiple oracles, e.g. 
learning from crowds,
     - methods for incorporating domain knowledge and constraints,
     - methods for timing the interaction and for combining different 
types of information,
     - online and ensemble methods for evolving models and systems, with 
specific switching and fusion techniques, and (inter-)active data 
integration technqiues,

(*) Innovative Use and Applications of Active, Semi-Supervised, Transfer 
Learning
     - for filtering, forgetting, resampling,
     - for active class or feature selection, e.g. from multi-modal data,
     - for detection of change, outliers, frauds, or attacks,
     - new interactive learning protocols and application scenarios, 
e.g., brain-computer interfaces, crowdsourcing, ...
     - in application in data-intensive science,
     - in applications with real-world deployment,

(*) Techniques for Combined Interactive Adaptive Learning
     - methods combining adaptive, active, semi-supervised, or transfer 
learning techniques,
     - cost-aware methods and methods for estimating the impact of 
employing additional resources, such as data or processing capacities, 
on the learning progress,
     - methodologies for the evaluation of such techniques, and 
comparative studies,
     - methods for automating the control of an interactive adaptive 
learning process.


We welcome submissions of *full papers* (max. 10 pages) and *extended 
abstracts* (up to 2 pages). Each paper will be single-blinded 
peer-reviewed, and upon selection be presented and discussed at the 
workshop. For extended abstracts, works-in-progress or industrial 
experiences are welcome. At least one author of each accepted paper must 
be registered to the conference. We intend to publish the workshop 
proceedings within the open-access, indexed CEUR Workshop Proceedings 
series. Please format your papers according to the LNCS format and 
submit them via EasyChair 
\url{https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ial2018}.

Important Dates:
   Paper Submission:     Monday, July 2, 2018 (Full papers)
                         Monday, July 23, 2018 (Extended abstracts)
   Author Notification:  Monday, July 23, 2018 (Full papers)
                         Monday, July 30, 2018 (Extended abstracts)
   Camera Ready:}        Monday, August 6, 2018
   Workshop:             Monday, September 10, 2018

We look forward to your contributions, the organisers,

Adrian Calma, Andreas Holzinger, Daniel Kottke, Georg Krempl, Vincent 
Lemaire, Robi Polikar, Bernhard Sick
