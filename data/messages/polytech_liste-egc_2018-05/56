Subject: [liste-egc] [CfP] - Call for prediction-challenge submissions for
 the 5th Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics (MLSA18)
 workshop @ ECML/PKDD 2018

Sports analytics has been a steadily growing and rapidly evolving area over
the last decade, but the research in the field is still held back by a lack of
publicly available data. In an attempt to provide more machine learning
researchers and sports enthusiasts the opportunity to play with sports data,
we are running a football pass prediction challenge in the context of our 5th
Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics workshop at ECML/PKDD
2018. The challenge is to predict the receiver of the pass given the locations
of all the players and the ball at the time of the pass.
<br>
<br>
The complete instructions as well as the dataset are available on GitHub:
https://github.com/JanVanHaaren/mlsa18-pass-prediction. We encourage
prediction-challenge participants to submit a paper describing their approach
to the workshop. Prediction-challenge papers can be 6 pages in the Springer
LNCS style. If you plan to participate in the challenge and submit a paper to
the workshop, then please get in touch with Jan Van Haaren
(j.vanhaaren@scisports.com).
