Subject: [liste-egc] [CfP] - Call for submissions for the 5th Machine
 Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics (MLSA18) workshop @
 ECML/PKDD 2018

Sports Analytics has been a steadily growing and rapidly evolving area over
the last decade both in US professional sports leagues and in European
football leagues. The recent implementation of strict financial fair-play
regulations in European football will certainly increase the importance of
Sports Analytics in the coming years. In addition, there is of course the
popularity of sports betting. The developed approaches are being used for
decision support in all aspects of professional sports, including:
<br><p>
- Analyzing positional data (tracking data)<br>
- Match strategy, tactics, and analysis<br>
- Player acquisition, player valuation, and team spending<br>
- Training regimens and focus<br>
- Injury prediction and prevention<br>
- Performance management and prediction<br>
- Match outcome and league table prediction<br>
- Tournament design and scheduling<br>
- Betting odds calculation<br>
The majority of techniques used in the field so far are statistical. However,
there has been growing interest in the Machine Learning and Data Mining
community about this topic. Building off our successful workshops on Sports
Analytics at ECML/PKDD 2013, ECML/PKDD 2015, ECML/PKDD 2016, and ECML/PKDD
2017, we wish to continue to grow this interest by hosting a fourth edition at
ECML/PKDD 2018. We think that the setting is interesting and challenging, and
can potentially be a source of new data. Furthermore, we believe that this
offers a great opportunity to bring people from outside of the Machine
Learning community into contact with typical ECML/PKDD contributors as well as
to highlight what the community has done and can do in the field of Sports
Analytics.

*Submissions*
<br><p>
The workshop solicits papers covering both predictive and descriptive Machine
Learning, Data Mining, and related approaches to Sports Analytics settings,
including, but not only the list of topics above. The following types of
papers can be submitted:<br>
- Long papers will be 9 pages of content and an unconstrained number of
references in the Springer LNCS style and should report on novel, unpublished
work that might not be quite mature enough for a conference or journal
submission.<br>
- Prediction challenge papers will be 6 pages in Springer LNCS style and
should describe the approach that participants in our football pass prediction
challenge have taken to produce their predictions.<br>
- Extended abstracts will be 2 pages in Springer LNCS style and summarize
recent publications fitting the workshop.<br>
<br><p>
