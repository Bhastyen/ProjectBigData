=3D=3D CFP =3D=3D

The 9th International Conference on Knowledge Capture aims at attracting re=
searchers from diverse areas of Artificial Intelligence, including knowledg=
e representation, knowledge acquisition, intelligent user interfaces, probl=
em-solving and reasoning, planning, agents, text extraction, and machine le=
arning, information enrichment and visualization, as well as researchers in=
terested in cyber-infrastructures to foster the publication, retrieval, reu=
se, and integration of data.

Today these data come from an increasingly heterogeneous set of resources t=
hat differ with regards to their domain, media format, quality, coverage, v=
iewpoint, bias, and so on.  More than the sheer amount of these data, their=
 heterogeneity allows us to arrive at better models and answer complex ques=
tions that cannot be addressed in isolation but require the interaction of =
different scientific fields or perspectives.

In most cases, knowledge is not captured as a means to an end but to, for i=
nstance, enable better user interfaces, improve retrieval beyond simple key=
word search, and so forth. For K-CAP 2017, we would like to focus on the cr=
eation, enrichment, querying, and maintenance of knowledge graphs (not nece=
ssarily limited to the Semantic Web technology stack) out of heterogeneous =
data sources.

=3D=3D RESEARCH TOPICS =3D=3D

The 9th International Conference on Knowledge Capture, K-CAP 2017, will fea=
ture a full papers track for research papers as well as an application pape=
rs track. However, this year=92s edition will also include a third track fo=
r short papers, vision papers, and late breaking results with a deadline in=
 late September. The main program will be accompanied by workshops on a ran=
ge of related topics.

The special theme of the conference this year will be on **Knowledge Graphs=
 from Heterogeneous Data**. Therefore, we especially encourage submissions =
of papers on the topics such as:

* Extracting knowledge graphs from unstructured/semi-structured and multi-m=
edia data
* Summarization techniques for knowledge graphs
* Visualization of knowledge graphs and visual query interfaces
* Statistical analysis from Web data
* Services and API for knowledge graphs
* Addressing scalability issues for distributed knowledge graphs
* Provenance, trust, and credibility as they relate to knowledge graphs
* Enrichment and cleaning of knowledge graphs and alignment to existing gra=
phs
* Hybrid approaches for knowledge capture combining knowledge engineering a=
nd machine learning
* Data dynamicity, heterogeneity, and decay in knowledge intensive systems

Submissions on more general topics, traditionally covered by the K-CAP conf=
erence series, are highly encouraged, including but not restricting to:

* Knowledge acquisition
* Knowledge authoring
* Knowledge extraction
* Knowledge management
* Knowledge publication
* Knowledge capture for the Semantic Web and the Web of Linked Data
* Knowledge capture and enrichment in specific domains such as the earth sc=
iences
* Collaborative and social approaches to knowledge management and acquisiti=
on
* Crowdsourcing for knowledge capture and refinement
* Knowledge Capture from Social Environments and Contexts
* Mixed-initiative planning and decision-support
* Problem-solving knowledge and methods
* Knowledge-based markup techniques
* Knowledge engineering and modeling methodologies
* Narrative intelligence
* Knowledge capture through storytelling
* Provenance and trust issues in knowledge intensive systems
* Services and applications that enable or utilize data capture techniques
* Semantic search and query enrichment
* Ontology engineering and engineering methodologies
* Ontology design patterns
* Similarity measurement and Analogy-based reasoning

=3D=3D SUBMISSIONS =3D=3D

Regular research papers should not be longer than 8 pages, including refere=
nces, while applications papers, short papers, vision papers, and late brea=
king results are limited to 4 pages.

For the application track, we encourage submissions of concrete application=
s in all the topics of the conference, as mentioned above. Submissions to t=
he application track should present applications, tools, or environments wh=
ich have been deployed and used by their target audiences such as research =
projects and research communities, or the industry. Accepted application pa=
pers will be presented at the conference and are also encouraged to take pa=
rt in the demo session.

All papers should be submitted through Easychair (using https://easychair.o=
rg/conferences/?conf=3Dkcap2017) and should be formatted according to the A=
CM format (2 column SIG Conference Proceedings template).


=3D=3D VENUE AND REGISTRATION =3D=3D

K-CAP2017 will be held at the Hilton Garden Inn Austin Downtown/Convention =
Center, in Austin, Texas.

Today these data come from an increasingly heterogeneous set of resources t=
hat differ with regards to their domain, media format, quality, coverage, v=
iewpoint, bias, and so on. &nbsp;More than
 the sheer amount of these data, their heterogeneity allows us to arrive at=
 better models and answer complex questions that cannot be addressed in iso=
lation but require the interaction of different scientific fields or perspe=
ctives.</span></div>

In most cases, knowledge is not captured as a means to an end but to, for i=
nstance, enable better user interfaces, improve retrieval beyond simple key=
word search, and so forth. For K-CAP
 2017, we would like to focus on the creation, enrichment, querying, and ma=
intenance of knowledge graphs (not necessarily limited to the Semantic Web =
technology stack) out of heterogeneous data sources.</span></div>
