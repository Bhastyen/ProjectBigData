Applications to attend SSSW 2016 - the 12tth Semantic Web Summer School - w=
ill close in 1 month!!

THE 12TH SEMANTIC WEB SUMMER SCHOOL - SSSW 2016
Bertinoro, near Bologna, Italy.
17th - 23rd July, 2016
http://sssw.org/2016, info@sssw16.org<mailto:info@sssw16.org>, Twitter: @ss=
sw2016

Applications to attend SSSW 2016 will close in on 4 April 2016. To ensure a=
 high ratio between tutors and students the school will be limited to 60 pa=
rticipants.

To apply, please follow the process described at http://sssw.org/2016/?page=
_id=3D16

The groundbreaking SSSW series of summer schools started in 2003. It is now=
 a well-established event within the research community and a role model fo=
r several other initiatives. Taking place in the beautiful village of Berti=
noro, Italy the programme of the summer school is centred on research and t=
he open challenges facing the semantic web and the related technologies. It=
 includes lectures, invited talks, practical research work and projects, le=
d by a set of tutors comprising leading researchers in the community and pr=
estigious invited speakers. SSSW also represents a unique opportunity for n=
etworking with research and industry leaders (including former students of =
the school), including of course, an exciting social programme in one of th=
e most beautiful locations in Italy.

SSSW is located in the beautiful location of Bertinoro, a small village nea=
r Bologna in Italy, and relies on an extended organising committee, with Va=
lentina Presutti from CNR, Mathieu d=E2=80=99Aquin from the Open University=
 and Oscar Corcho from UPM. Since Semantic Web technologies and practices a=
re now well established, the focus of the school is on research,  and on th=
e open challenges that are being faced by the scientific community related =
to the Semantic Web. Keeping the =E2=80=9Cmixed=E2=80=9D approach pioneered=
 in the previous editions of SSSW, invited speeches and lectures by some of=
 the greatest researchers in the area are complemented with =E2=80=9CResear=
ch in Practice=E2=80=9D sessions where key research questions are being inv=
estigated and collectively discussed.

Work on developing and presenting a project in cooperation with other parti=
cipants serves as a means of consolidating the knowledge and skills gained =
from lectures and practice sessions. It also introduces an element of compe=
tition among teams, as prizes are awarded to the best projects at the end o=
f the week. As a wide range of skills are required when working in this are=
a, a =E2=80=9Chackday=E2=80=9D will also be organised during the week, as a=
 break from the research focus where participants will be able to apply and=
 show off their technical skills too.

SSSW 2016 will provide a stimulating and enjoyable environment in which par=
ticipants will benefit not only from the formal and practical sessions but =
also from informal and social interactions with established researchers and=
 the other participants to the school. To further facilitate interaction an=
d exchange of ideas, a poster session will also take place, which will prov=
ide an opportunity for attendees to present and obtain feedback on their re=
search.

HOW TO APPLY

We welcome applicants from anywhere in the world. Normally, but not exclusi=
vely, applicants will be postgraduate students in relevant disciplines with=
 some knowledge of semantic and web technologies. Some basic acquaintance w=
ith knowledge representation languages for the Semantic Web (RDF, OWL, etc.=
) is required.

The deadline for applications is the 4 April 2016. Please follow the instru=
ctions at http://sssw.org/2016/?page_id=3D16 to apply.

Accepted candidates are expected to arrive on Sunday, July 17th, between 3p=
m and 6pm and to participate fully in the activities of the school until it=
s conclusion, at 2pm on Saturday, July 23rd. Applicants should keep in mind=

mselves to a full participation for the whole duration of the school. Stude=
nts are also required to bring and present a  poster at the summer school, =
describing their own research.

Apart from activities directly related to lectures, the summer school sched=
ule is rightly famous for its unrivalled social programme, which enables in=

 tutors, invited speakers, school staff, etc. These events include a gala d=
inner, picnic at the swimming pool, a disco, and sport activities.

<div>The groundbreaking SSSW series of summer schools started in 2003. It i=
s now a well-established event within the research community and a role mod=
el for several other initiatives. Taking place in the beautiful village of =
Bertinoro, Italy the programme of
 the summer school is centred on research and the open challenges facing th=
e semantic web and the related technologies. It includes lectures, invited =
talks, practical research work and projects, led by a set of tutors compris=
ing leading researchers in the community
 and prestigious invited speakers. SSSW also represents a unique opportunit=
y for networking with research and industry leaders (including former stude=
nts of the school), including of course, an exciting social programme in on=
e of the most beautiful locations
 in Italy.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>SSSW is located in the beautiful location of Bertinoro, a small villag=
e near Bologna in Italy, and relies on an extended organising committee, wi=
th Valentina Presutti from CNR, Mathieu d=E2=80=99Aquin from the Open Unive=
rsity and Oscar Corcho from UPM. Since Semantic
 Web technologies and practices are now well established, the focus of the =
school is on research, &nbsp;and on the open challenges that are being face=
d by the scientific community related to the Semantic Web. Keeping the =E2=
=80=9Cmixed=E2=80=9D approach pioneered in the previous
 editions of SSSW, invited speeches and lectures by some of the greatest re=
searchers in the area are complemented with =E2=80=9CResearch in Practice=
=E2=80=9D sessions where key research questions are being investigated and =
collectively discussed.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Work on developing and presenting a project in cooperation with other =
participants serves as a means of consolidating the knowledge and skills ga=
ined from lectures and practice sessions. It also introduces an element of =
competition among teams, as prizes
 are awarded to the best projects at the end of the week. As a wide range o=
f skills are required when working in this area, a =E2=80=9Chackday=E2=80=
=9D will also be organised during the week, as a break from the research fo=
cus where participants will be able to apply and show
 off their technical skills too.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>SSSW 2016 will provide a stimulating and enjoyable environment in whic=
h participants will benefit not only from the formal and practical sessions=
 but also from informal and social interactions with established researcher=
s and the other participants to
 the school. To further facilitate interaction and exchange of ideas, a pos=
ter session will also take place, which will provide an opportunity for att=
endees to present and obtain feedback on their research.</div>
