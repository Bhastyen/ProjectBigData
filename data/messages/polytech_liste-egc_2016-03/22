Call for Papers: ER 2016
========================

The 35th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling
http://er2016.cs.titech.ac.jp/

November 14-17, 2016
Gifu, Japan

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER) is the leading
international forum for presenting and discussing current research on
conceptual modeling. The topics of interest span the entire spectrum of
conceptual modeling including research and practice in areas such as:
theories of concepts underlying conceptual modeling, methods and tools
for developing and communicating conceptual models, techniques for
transforming conceptual models into effective implementations, and the
impact of conceptual modeling techniques on databases, business strategies
and information systems development.

We solicit submission of original research papers, as well as experience
and vision papers from both researchers and practitioners. Topics of
interests include, but are not restricted to:

   - Foundations and Concept Formalization
   - Big Data
   - NoSQL Databases and Enterprise Business Models
   - Semantic Web, Cloud Computing, and Web Information Systems
   - Enterprise Architectures and Service-Oriented Architectures
   - Quality and Metrics of Conceptual Models
   - Empirical Studies of Conceptual Modeling
   - Ontology Modeling and Deployment
   - Business Process Modeling
   - Semi-structured Data and XML
   - Integration of Conceptual Models and Database Schemas
   - Information Retrieval, Filtering, Classification, Summarization, and
     Visualization
   - Methodologies and Tools for Conceptual Design
   - Requirements Engineering
   - Reuse and Patterns
   - Reverse Engineering and Roundtrip Engineering
   - Schema Evolution and Management of Database Constraints
   - Spatial, Temporal, and Multimedia Aspects in Conceptual Models
   - Metadata and Applications
   - Data Warehousing, Data Mining, and Business Intelligence and
     Analytics
   - Applications to Bioinformatics, Cyber Security, and Privacy
   - Data Semantics and Integrity Constraints
   - Advanced and Cross-Disciplinary Applications of Conceptual Models
   - Human-Computer Interaction
   - Role of Conceptual Modeling Techniques in Emerging Areas (Social
     Networks, Mobile Computing, Cloud Computing, Internet of Objects,
     Deep Learning, Serious Games and Pedagogical Models, etc.)

authors must submit manuscripts using the LNCS style. The page limit for
submitted papers (as well as for final, camera-ready papers) is 14.
Manuscripts not submitted in the LNCS style or exceeding the page limit
will not be reviewed and automatically rejected. A paper submitted to ER
2016 may not be under review for any other conference or journal during
the time it is being considered for ER 2016. Submitted papers must
demonstrate to be aware of the state-of-the art literature in conceptual
modeling by properly citing relevant papers in the field.

All submissions should be submitted through EasyChair.

Springer Verlag will sponsor two awards:

Best Student Paper Award:
     to be given to the best paper whose first author is a student.
