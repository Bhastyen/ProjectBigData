			CALL FOR DEMOS

We solicit submissions for demos for ECML PKDD 2016 in Riva del Garda, Italy. Submissions must describe working systems and be based on state-of-the-art machine learning and data mining technology. These systems may be innovative prototype implementations or mature systems that use machine learning techniques and knowledge discovery processes in a real setting. Systems that use basic statistics are not acceptable. A commercial software is not acceptable.

The accepted papers for demos will be included in the conference proceedings, to be published by Springer Verlag in the "Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence" (LNAI) Series. The demos will be presented in a special demonstration session. At least
  one of the demo submitters must register for the conference, and perform the demo on site.

----Submission Guidelines----

All aspects of the submission and notification process will be handled online via the conference CMT submission site.

Please choose the right track during the submission. Instructions concerning the submission (except for the "reproducible research" part which is not relevant for a demo paper), camera-ready formatting and copyright transfer for conference papers also hold for demo papers, unless otherwise specified.

A demonstration submission must be up to 4 pages long. It must provide adequate information on the system’s components and the way the system is operated, including e.g. screenshots.

Submitters should keep in mind that the description of a demo has inherently different content than a research paper submitted to the main conference. A successful demonstration paper provides satisfactory answers the following questions:

- What are the innovative aspects or in what way/area does it represent the state of the art?
- Who are the target users and why is the system interesting/useful for them?
- If there are similar/related pieces of software, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the presented one?

The formatting guidelines of Springer Verlag for the LNAI series apply, and the author instructions and style files under http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html must be used. For inquiries concerning submissions please contact the Demo Track Chairs; contact data below.

---Important Dates---

- Demo submission deadline: 13 May 2016
- Notification of acceptance: 20 June 2016
- Camera-ready paper due: 1st July 2016 (aligned to the deadline of the main conference)

---Contacts---

For further information please contact the Demo Track Chairs:
- Elisa Fromont, Univ Saint-Etienne, France
- Nikolaj Tatti, Univ Aalto, Finland
