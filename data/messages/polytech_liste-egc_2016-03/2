Subject: [liste-egc] 1st CFP: Fuzzy Sets & Systems Special issue : Fuzzy
 approaches for Handling Big Data


=======================================================================

[Apologies if you receives multiple copies of this CFP]
*************************************************************************************** 

Fuzzy Sets & Systems (FSS) 
(http://www.journals.elsevier.com/fuzzy-sets-and-systems/)
   Call for Papers for a Special Issue on Fuzzy Approaches for Handling 
Big Data
  ********************************************************************************


Guest Editors:
Prof. Sadok BEN YAHIA, Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, Tunsia
Prof. Anne LAURENT, University of Montpellier, France
Prof. Gabriella PASI, University of Milano, Italy


Scope and Topics:

Big data is often referred to as being related to the paradigms of the 
4V (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity). Huge data sets require ad hoc 
computational approaches to be managed and analyzed. Besides the 
efficiency issue related to their dimensions, there is the important and 
complex issue of mining useful information from data.

Several are the scientific challenges associated with big data, ranging 
from data capture, storage, sharing, modeling, analysis, and 
visualization. Among the complex aspects to be addressed there is the 
integration across heterogeneous, interdependent complex data resources 
for real-time analytics and decision making.

This special issue aims to publish selected research articles presenting 
fuzzy logic based techniques in the emerging field of Big Data. More 
specifically, it seeks for contributions standing at the cross-road of 
theory and applications of fuzzy techniques in Big Data, including:

* Scalability and performance of fuzzy algorithms, data structures;
* Novel fuzzy techniques to manage big data;
* Applications of fuzzy techniques to large datasets gathered in 
business intelligence, finance, healthcare, bioinformatics, smart sensor 
networks, cyber security, etc;
* Collaborative approaches where human and machine expertise are used in 
a complementary manner.

Submission procedure
