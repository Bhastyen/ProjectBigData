proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the main =
conference. The workshop program seeks to provide venues for specialist =
groups to meet, to generate focused discussion on specific sub-areas =
within Service Oriented Computing and to engage in community-building =
activities. The workshops should provide a discussion forum for =
researchers in topics related to main theme of the conference, either on =
specific research themes or in emerging areas of research.

The workshops will be held on 10 October 2016 at the Alberta, Canada.

IMPORTANT DATES
Workshop Proposal Submission Deadline: 11 April 2016=20
Workshop Acceptance Notification:  08 May 2016

WORKSHOPS ORGANIZATION
Workshop organizers will be responsible for the following:
* Constituting the workshop program committee
* Advertising the workshop
* Managing the paper review and selection process
* Ensuring that at least one author of each accepted paper attends to =
present the paper (this may require announcing regulations that =
stipulate this as a prerequisite for the publication of the paper in the =
workshop proceedings.)
* Ensuring that the workshop delivers useful scholarly =E2=81=84 =
research value via active discussion / debate.
* Workshops may be held for a full day or for half a day.
* At least one author for each paper accepted to a workshop will need to =
register for the workshop program.

WORKSHOPS PUBLICATION
The conference solicits outstanding original research and practice =
papers on all aspects of service-oriented computing. Papers should =
clearly demonstrate the research or practical contribution, the =
relevance to the field, and the relationship to prior work. Submitted =
papers will be evaluated according to their rigor, significance, =
originality, technical quality, and exposition. All papers will be =
reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.=20

It is likely that, as in previous years, the post-proceedings of the =
accepted workshops will be jointly published as a Springer volume. A =
formal proposal to Springer will only be made after the accepted =
workshops and their program committees are finalized. Workshops =
organizers can opt out of the volume should they wish to; a decision on =
this is required at workshop submission stage for planning purposes.

Working notes of the workshops (including papers to be eventually =
published in the joint workshop volume) will be printed locally for =
distribution on the workshop day.

* Plans for invited talks if any.

workshops.
