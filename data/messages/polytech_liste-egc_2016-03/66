                       CALL FOR PAPERS ICGI 2016
                       =========================
                          icgi2016.tudelft.nl

SCOPE, LOCATION AND PROCEEDINGS
ICGI 2016 is the 13th edition of the International Conference on
Grammatical Inference series, held every two years.

The conference will be held at Delft University of Technology; in
Delft, the Netherlands, from October 5-7, 2016. Delft is one of the
most beautiful and historic cities in the world, situated in the
central (western) part of the Netherlands. The city is directly
accessible by train from Schiphol airport (a large international
airport near Amsterdam). The conference will be hosted in the
"Mekelzaal", a beautiful historic venue in a small science museum at
the university campus.

The conference proceedings will be published with the JMLR Workshop
and Conference Proceedings series (http://jmlr.org/proceedings/).

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper submission deadline: May 29, 2016 (AOE).
Notification of acceptance: July 17, 2016.
Camera-ready copy: August 28, 2016.
Conference: October 5-7, 2016.

AREAS OF INTEREST
The conference is on grammatical inference. Key interests are
machine-learning methods applied to discrete combinatorial structures
such as strings, trees, or graphs, and algorithms for learning
symbolic models such as grammars, automata, Markov models, or pattern
languages. The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation
and discussion of original research papers on all aspects of
grammatical inference including, but not limited to:
- Theoretical aspects of grammatical inference: learning paradigms,
   learnability results, complexity of learning.
- Theoretical and experimental analysis of different grammatical
   inference approaches, including artificial neural networks,
   statistical methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic
   approaches, minimum description length, complexity-theoretic
   approaches, heuristic methods, etc.
- Algorithms and frameworks for learning models representing language
   classes inside and outside the Chomsky hierarchy, including tree and
   graph grammars.
- Learning models with additional, sometimes numeric, inputs/outputs
   such as transducers, register automata, timed automata, and
   semi-hidden Markov models.
- Active learning of these and other languages.
- Methods for estimating probability distributions over strings,
   trees, graphs, or any data used as input for symbolic models.
- Combinations of grammatical inference with related fields such as
   semantic representations, formal methods, or multi-agent systems.
- Novel approaches to grammatical inference: induction by DNA
   computing or quantum computing, evolutionary approaches, spectral
   algorithms, using combinatorial solvers, new representation spaces,
   etc.
- Successful applications of grammatical inference to tasks such as
   natural language processing, unsupervised parsing, bioinformatics,
   web interface design, robot navigation, machine translation, pattern
   recognition, language acquisition, software engineering,
   computational linguistics, spam and malware detection, cognitive
   psychology, etc.

AUTHOR GUIDELINES
We invite three types of papers:
- Formal and/or technical papers describe original solutions
   (theoretical, methodological or conceptual) in the field of
   grammatical inference. A technical paper should clearly describe the
   situation or problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the
   position or solution suggested and the benefits of the contribution.
- Exploratory papers can describe completely new research positions or
   approaches. Open problems may be suggested. Current limits can be
   discussed. In all cases rigor in presentation will be required. Such
   papers must describe precisely the situation, problem, or challenge
   addressed, and demonstrate how current methods, tools, ways of
   reasoning, may be inadequate. The authors must rigorously present
   their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness to
   addressing the identified situation.
- Tool papers describing a new tool for grammatical inference. The
   tool must be publicly available and the paper has to contain several
   use-case studies describing the use of the tool. In addition, the
   paper should clearly describe the implemented algorithms, input
   parameters and syntax, and the produced output.
There are no restrictions on the domain of application as long as the
paper provides sufficient background information.

CONFERENCE FORMAT
The conference will include plenary and invited talks, tool
demonstrations, and poster presentations of accepted papers.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS
Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper that
represents original and previously unpublished work. Simultaneous
submission to other conferences with published proceedings is not
allowed.

All papers should be submitted electronically by May 29, 2016 AOE; the
submission URL is: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgi2016.

Each paper should contain title, authors and affiliation, mailing
address, a brief abstract describing the work and at least three
keywords that describe the contents of the work.

Papers must be submitted in pdf format. The total length of the paper
should not exceed 12 pages on A4-size paper. The use of LaTeX is
strongly encouraged. Prospective authors are strongly recommended to
use the JMLR style file for LaTeX available here:
http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html.

We are looking forward to your submissions.
