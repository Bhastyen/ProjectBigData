About IEEE SCC 2016

*Services account for a major part of the IT industry today. Companies 
increasingly like to focus on their core expertise area and use IT 
services to address all their peripheral needs. Services Computing is a 
new science which aims to study and better understand the foundations of 
this highly popular industry. It covers the science and technology of 
leveraging computing and information technology to model, create, 
operate, and manage business services. Like its predecessors, SCC 2016 
will contribute in building the pillars of this important science and 
shaping the future of Services Computing.
Services Computing currently shapes the thinking of business modeling, 
business consulting, solution creation, service delivery, and software 
architecture design, development and deployment. The global nature of 
Services Computing leads to many opportunities and challenges and 
creates a new networked economic structure for supporting different 
business models. SCC 2016 will help in bridging the gap between business 
services and information technology by driving research in technologies 
such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process 
integration and management, service engineering, cloud computing and Web 
2.0. Extended versions of selected research track papers will be invited 
for potential publication in the IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 
(TSC), "International Journal of Services Computing (IJSC), , 
International Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR), and International 
Journal of Business Process Integration and Management (IJBPIM). Both 
TSC and JWSR are indexed by SCI and EI [Link]. The TSC's impact factor 
in 2014 is 3.049. SCC Proceedings are EI indexed.

SCC 2016 will co-locate with the following service-oriented sister 
conferences: the 23rd IEEE International Conference on Web Services 
(ICWS 2016), the 9th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing 
(SCC 2016), the 5th International Congress on Big Data (c), the 5th IEEE 
International Conference on Mobile Services (MS 2016), and the IEEE 2016 
World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2016). All six co-located theme 
topic conferences will all center around "services," while each focusing 
on exploring different themes (web-based services, cloud-based services, 
Big Data-based services, services innovation lifecycle, mobile services, 
and industry-specific services and enabling technologies).

application track, and a short paper track. The SCC 2016 will highlight 
foundational work that strives to push beyond the limits of existing 
business services platforms and products, including experimental 
efforts, innovative systems and investigations that identify weaknesses 
in the existing services computing technology.
The SCC 2016 seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting 
substantive new work in various aspects of services innovation lifecycle 
management. Submissions MUST clearly indicate their contributions to the 
field of services computing and properly cite related work in the field, 
such as those published in the proceedings of BigData, ICWS, SCC, CLOUD,

      About IEEE SCC 2016<br>
      <br>
    </b>Services account for a major part of the IT industry today.
    Companies increasingly like to focus on their core expertise area
    and use IT services to address all their peripheral needs. Services
    Computing is a new science which aims to study and better understand
    the foundations of this highly popular industry. It covers the
    science and technology of leveraging computing and information
    technology to model, create, operate, and manage business services.
    Like its predecessors, SCC 2016 will contribute in building the
    pillars of this important science and shaping the future of Services
    Computing.<br>
    Services Computing currently shapes the thinking of business
    modeling, business consulting, solution creation, service delivery,
    and software architecture design, development and deployment. The
    global nature of Services Computing leads to many opportunities and
    challenges and creates a new networked economic structure for
    supporting different business models. SCC 2016 will help in bridging
    the gap between business services and information technology by
    driving research in technologies such as service-oriented
    architecture (SOA), business process integration and management,
    service engineering, cloud computing and Web 2.0. Extended versions
    of selected research track papers will be invited for potential
    publication in the IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC),
    "International Journal of Services Computing (IJSC), , International
    Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR), and International Journal
    of Business Process Integration and Management (IJBPIM). Both TSC
    and JWSR are indexed by SCI and EI [Link]. The TSC's impact factor
    in 2014 is 3.049. SCC Proceedings are EI indexed.<br>
    <br>
    SCC 2016 will co-locate with the following service-oriented sister
    conferences: the 23rd IEEE International Conference on Web Services
    (ICWS 2016), the 9th IEEE International Conference on Cloud
    Computing (SCC 2016), the 5th International Congress on Big Data
    (c), the 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services (MS
    2016), and the IEEE 2016 World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2016).
    All six co-located theme topic conferences will all center around
    "services," while each focusing on exploring different themes
    (web-based services, cloud-based services, Big Data-based services,
    services innovation lifecycle, mobile services, and
    industry-specific services and enabling technologies).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    All topics relevant to Internet services lifecycle are of interest.
    SCC 2016 will organize refereed paperreviews in 7 research areas

    The technical program of SCC 2016 will include a research track, a
    application track, and a short paper track. The SCC 2016 will
    highlight foundational work that strives to push beyond the limits
    of existing business services platforms and products, including
    experimental efforts, innovative systems and investigations that
    identify weaknesses in the existing services computing technology.<br>
    The SCC 2016 seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting
    substantive new work in various aspects of services innovation
    lifecycle management. Submissions MUST clearly indicate their
    contributions to the field of services computing and properly cite
    related work in the field, such as those published in the
    proceedings of BigData, ICWS, SCC, CLOUD, SERVICES, APSCC, ECOWS,
    and related journals including TSC, JWSR, and IJBPIM.<br>
    <br>
    All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3
    program committee members. Accepted and presented papers from all
    SCC tracks will appear in the conference proceedings published by
    IEEE. Extended versions of selected research track papers will be
    invited for potential publication in the IEEE Transactions on
    Services Computing (TSC), International Journal of Web Services
    Research (JWSR), and International Journal of Business Process
    Integration and Management (IJBPIM). Both TSC and JWSR are indexed
    by SCI and EI [Link].  SCC Proceedings are EI indexed. The TSC's
    impact factor in 2014 is 3.049.<br>
    Submitted research and application track manuscripts will be limited
    to 8 (IEEE Proceedings style) pages and REQUIRED to be formatted
    using the IEEE Proceedings template in WORD or Latex Package.
    Unformatted papers and papers beyond the page limit will not be
    reviewed. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word
    format) is required. Detailed instructions for electronic paper
    preparation and submission, panel proposals, tutorial proposals,
    workshop proposals, and review process can be found at conference
    website.<br>
    At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register
    to the conference and present the paper. One Best Paper award and
    one Best Student Paper award will be granted at SCC 2016. The first
    author of the best student paper must be a full-time student.<br>
