Important Dates

-Notification of paper acceptance: June 6th, 2016
-Camera-ready submission (CCIS): June 13th, 2016

Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scalable Machine Learning occurs when Statistics, Systems, Machine Learning
and Data Mining are combined into flexible, often non-parametric, and
scalable techniques for analyzing large amounts of data at internet scale.
In many fields, such as multimedia, insurance information systems,
bio-informatics, and with advances in data collection and storage
technologies have allowed companies to accumulate and to acquire vast
amounts of data (Terabyte, Petabyte, and sometimes Zettabyte). Furthermore,
proprietary data sources may be enriched and merged with other
heterogeneous sources developed by other organisations including government
data named open data. In this context, it appears very important to use
techniques and technologies of =E2=80=9CBig Data=E2=80=9D (such as MapReduc=
e, cloud,
parallel and streaming algorithms, etc.) in addition to rethink our
algorithms to make them scalable.

This workshop offers a meeting opportunity for academic and industry
researchers in the fields of machine learning, neural network, data
visualization, data mining and Big Data to discuss new areas of learning
methods and experimental design. We encourage researchers and practitioners
to submit papers describing original research addressing complex data and
scalable machine learning challenges.

This includes but is not restricted to the following topics:

-Clustering and classification for Big Data
-Neural networks approaches
-Distributed neural networks
-Deep learning
-Online learning for high-velocity streaming data
-Methods of detecting changes in evolving data
-Clustering and classification of data of changing distributions
-Visualization of big data and data streams
-Theoretical frameworks for big data mining
-Scalable algorithms for big data
-Interactive stream mining techniques
-Distributed ensemble classifier
-Collaborative methods
-Parallel and distributed computational intelligence
-Parallel and distributed computing for big data analytics (cloud,
map-reduce, etc.)
-Future research challenges of data stream mining

 The Workshop is supported by the INNS, and the group of "Data Mining et
Apprentissage" of Soci=C3=A9t=C3=A9 Fran=C3=A7aise de Statistique (French S=
tatistical
Society).

Paper Submission and Publication
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Original works submitted as a regular paper limited to a maximum of 14
pages in Springer format will be published in the proceedings to be
available electronically as a Springer book in ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT
SYSTEMS AND COMPUTING Series, to download for delegates.

Papers submitted to this workshop should use easychair link :
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsml20160

It will be peer-reviewed by at least three PC members on the basis of
technical quality, relevance, originality, significance and clarity.

At least one author of an accepted submission to the conference should
register with a regular fee to present their work at the conference.
