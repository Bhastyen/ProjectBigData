*IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing (CBDCom 
2016)**
**July 18-21, Toulouse, France

**http://cbdcom2016.sciencesconf.org/



NEW DEADLINE:

**Submission deadline: March 25, 2016*


**
Cloud is a virtual computing resource, which realizes self-maintenance 
and management, usually in the form of some large server cluster, 
including computing servers, storage servers, bandwidth resources, etc. 
Cloud computing is the fusion and development of grid computing, 
distributed computing, parallel computing, utility computing, network 
storage technologies, virtualization, load balancing and other 
traditional computer technologies and network technology. 
Virtualization, dynamicity and scalability, the distributed mass data 
storage and management, as well as flexible service, are the main 
technologies of cloud computing. There are still many challenges in 
cloud systems and platform, cloud computing, database, virtualization, 
reuse and elasticity problems.


Big data overall architecture consists of three layers: data storage, 
data processing and data analysis. Data storage layer stores complex 
type and mass data, data processing layer realizes real-time processing 
of massive data, and only through data analysis layer, smart, in-depth 
and valuable information are got. When talking about big data, one 
thinks first to the 4V characteristics of big data, namely Volumes, 
Variety, Velocity, and Veracity. Big data processing key technology 
generally includes: data acquisition, data pre-processing, data storage 
and data management, data analysis and mining, big show and application 
(big data retrieval, data visualization, big data applications, data 
security, etc.).


/The IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing is a 
premier forum for researchers, practitioners, developers and users who 
are interested in cloud computing and big data to explore new ideas, 
techniques and tools, as well as to exchange experience. Besides the 
latest research achievements. This conference also covers innovative 
commercial data management systems, innovative commercial applications 
of cloud computing and big data technology, and experience in applying 
recent research advances to real-world problems. After the success of 
IEEE CBDCom 2015, Beijing China,. CBDCom 2016 will be the second edition 
of the international Conference.//
