Business Informatics

Business Informatics is the scientific discipline targeting information
processes and related phenomena in their socio-economical business
context, including companies, organizations, administrations and society
in general. Business Informatics is a fertile ground for research with the
potential for immense and tangible impact. As a field of study, it
endeavors to take a systematic and analytic approach in aligning core
concepts from management science, organizational science, economics,
information science, and informatics into an integrated engineering
science.

Goal of the conference series

The goal of the CBI series of conferences is to bring together existing
Business Informatics related research domains and stimulate discussion,
synergy and integration of their respective research results and
activities. Accordingly, the CBI conferences use a format that enables in
depth discussions among researchers in their respective domains during the
conference. In addition, the contributions and discussions among the
different domains are channeled towards a series of books dedicated to
Advances in Business Informatics. For more information on the CBI series,
refer to: www.cbi-series.org

CBI Conference

The CBI is aimed at creating a forum for researchers and practitioners
from various fields that contribute to the construction, use and
maintenance of information systems and the organizational context they are
embedded in. Last but not least, we want to offer a common platform for
Computer Science and Information Systems researchers. The benefits of such
a cross-disciplinary conception are contrasted by a challenge: Authors who
submit a paper take the risk to be assessed by standards that are
different from those they are used to in their own communities. The CBI's
organization accounts for this challenge. It comprises various Tracks that
represent more than one individual community. Tracks are not only intended
to represent a certain subject area, but also to include papers from
different communities. The industry track aims at dealing with the
following challenges: What challenges do industry/organizations/government
have that Business Informatics research should help solve? What do
industry experts think of Business Informatics research? What about
brilliant failures and other success stories? What about Business
Informatics happening in industry?

Best CBI papers will be invited to a special issue in Enterprise Modelling
and Information Systems Architectures (EMISA) - an International Journal.

When submitting a paper, authors are expected to name the Track they feel
most related to.

publication elsewhere.

Proceedings

The proceedings of the CBI series are published by the IEEE as an
electronic publication with its own ISBN number. The proceedings are made
available to the conference participants by means of a USB stick, while
also being included in the IEEE digital library. Depending on their topic,
outstanding papers are recommended to one of a number of renowned
journals. In particular, best CBI papers will be invited to a special
issue in Enterprise Modelling and Information Systems Architectures
(EMISA) - An International Journal.

Reviewing

All papers will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers.
The reviewing process of the CBI conference series aims to provide authors
with valuable feedback on their papers, even when a submission is
rejected. As such, the CBI conference series operates under the principle
that a serious submission deserves a serious review.
