OVERVIEW

Cultural Heritage is gaining a lot of attention from academic and
industry perspectives. Scientific researchers, organizations,
associations, schools are looking for relevant technologies for
annotating, integrating, sharing, accessing, visualizing, analyzing the
mine of cultural data, taking also into account profiles and preferences
of end users. Several national (CATCH in the Netherlands, FinnONTO in
Finland, and KMM in Sweden, PATRIMA in France, etc.) and European
programmes (EUROPEANA, PARTHENOS) have been launched to these directions.
If most of cultural information systems developed in these programmes
begin to process data based on the syntactic, or structural level,
without leveraging the rich semantic structures underlying the content,
during the last decade Semantic Web solutions have also been proposed to
explicit these semantics structures and make them machine operable and
interoperable. In parallel, resources such as the CIDOC-CRMs ecosystem
have matured. As institutions bring their data to the Semantic Web
level, the tasks of data integrating, sharing, mining, analyzing,
visualizing, etc. are now to be conceived in this new and very rich
framework.
Several large conferences on Semantic Web exist, and several large
conferences on Digital Humanities including Cultural Heritage topics
exist. As data is at the core of Cultural Heritage systems, this is
ADBIS, a conference centered on database and information system topics,
who host the Semantic Web for Cultural Heritage workshop. It is intended
to be a forum for interdisciplinary research teams, involved in Semantic
Web solutions for Cultural Heritage. Interdisciplinarity is mandatory,
as the Semantic Web is a matter of computer, information and data
scientists, while the Cultural Heritage field brings together actors
from various Humanities and Social Sciences disciplines. In this novel
collaboration space, it is crucial to have places and times to meet,
share and discuss methods, tools, knowledge and understanding from
different points of views.
