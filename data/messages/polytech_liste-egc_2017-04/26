OVERVIEW

During the last decade, Semantic Web solutions have been proposed to 
explicit the semantics of Cultural Heritage data, making it machine 
operable and interoperable. Such solutions are at the kernel of 
resources such as the CIDOC-CRM’s ecosystem. As cultural institutions 
bring their data to the Semantic Web level, the tasks of data 
integrating, sharing, visualizing, analyzing, mining, etc. are now to be 
conceived in this new and very rich framework. The Semantic Web for 
Cultural Heritage workshop is intended to be a forum for 
interdisciplinary research teams, involved in Semantic Web based 
solutions for Cultural Heritage. In this novel interdisciplinary 
collaboration space, it is crucial to have places and times to meet, 
share and discuss methods, tools, knowledge and understanding from 
different points of views.
