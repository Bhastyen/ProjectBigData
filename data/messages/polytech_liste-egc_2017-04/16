About PRIMA:
************************
Agent-based Computing addresses the challenges in managing distributed 
computing systems and networks through monitoring, communication, 
consensus-based decision-making and coordinated actuation. As a result, 
intelligent agents and multi-agent systems have demonstrated the 
capability to use intelligence, knowledge representation and reasoning, 
and other social metaphors like ‘trust’, ‘game’ and ‘institution’, not 
only to address real-world problems in a human-like way but also to 
transcend human performance. This has had a transformative impact in 
many application domains, particularly in e-commerce, and also in 
planning, logistics, manufacturing, robotics, decision support, 
transportation, entertainment, emergency relief & disaster management, 
and data mining & analytics.

The 20th International Conference on Principles and Practice of 
Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2017) invites submissions of original, 
unpublished, theoretical and applied work on any such topic, and 
encourages reports on the development of prototype and deployed agent 
systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel agent system 
capabilities.

************************
Information for Authors
************************
The PRIMA 2017 Program Committee invites submissions of original, 
unpublished, theoretical and applied work strongly relevant to 
multiagent systems, including reports on the development of prototype 
and deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel 
agent system capabilities. An indicative list of topics is provided below.
Papers should be at most 16 pages in length in the Springer LNCS format. 
All accepted papers will be published in Springer’s LNAI series.
Papers are to be submitted through the Easychair Conference Management 
System:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=prima2017.
