***********
Description
***********


We invite submissions of papers describing designs and implementations=20
of solutions and systems for practical tasks in data mining, data=20
analytics, data science, and applied machine learning. The primary=20
emphasis is on papers that either solve or advance the understanding of=20
issues related to deploying data science technologies in the real world.


Submitted papers will go through a peer review process.


The Applied Data Science Track is distinct from the Research Track in=20
that submissions focus on real-world problems and systems that are=20
deployed or are in the process of being deployed. Submissions must=20
clearly identify one of the following three categories they fall into:=20
=E2=80=9Cdeployed=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cin-progress=E2=80=9D, or =E2=80=9Cob=
servational=E2=80=9D. The ADS Chairs might=20
shift a submission from one category to another, if they find that the=20
submission is misplaced. The criteria for submissions in each category=20
are as follows:


- CATEGORY Deployed: Must describe implementation of a system that=20
solves a significant real-world problem and is in current use. The paper=20
should present the problem, its significance to the application domain,=20
the decisions and tradeoffs made when making design choices for the=20
solution, the deployment challenges, and the lessons learned. Evidence=20
must be provided that the solution has been deployed by quantifying=20
post-launch performance. Papers that describe enabling infrastructure=20
for large-scale deployment of applied machine learning also fall in this=20
category. An example might be a deployed system that collects heartbeat=20
audio from mobile phones during a marathon race and uses machine=20
learning to identify potentially irregular signals and to alert support=20
personnel.


- CATEGORY In-progress: As above, except that the system has not been=20
deployed yet or (rarely!) a conclusion has been reached that the problem=20
is unsolvable. In addition to the content required for deployed solution=20
papers, in-progress papers must explain what fundamental insights were=20
achieved so far, what milestones were reached, and what are the=20
obstacles to deployment. Straightforward improvements over trivial=20
baseline solutions are unlikely to qualify. Continuing the example=20
above, an in-progress paper might present a system that achieves=20
reasonable error rates in an experiment with many volunteers but suffers=20
from interferences among mobiles that are located very close to each othe=
r.




- CATEGORY Observational: Must describe important insights into the=20
input data and/or the performance of a significant real world=20
applications and explain their practical impact. Continuing the example=20
above, an observational paper might present an analysis of a large=20
number of recordings taken during in-hospital cardiac stress tests=20
juxtaposing the system=E2=80=99s performance to that of human cardiologis=
ts, the=20
correlation between =E2=80=9Cmurmurs=E2=80=9D and other heart tests, the =
size of the=20
models that can analyze the audio satisfactorily, etc, and from here=20
derive whether such a system is currently realistic or will have to wait=20
for better sensors and more on-device computing power.

Applied Data Science Track, can be found under

**********************
Submission directions
**********************
KDD is a dual track conference hosting both a Research track and an=20
Applied Data Science track. Due to the large number of submissions,=20
papers submitted to the Research track will not be considered for=20
publication in the Applied Data Science track and vice versa. Authors=20
are encouraged to read the track descriptions carefully and to choose an=20
appropriate track for their submissions. Following KDD conference=20
tradition, reviews are not double-blind, and author names and=20
affiliations should be listed.


Submissions are limited to a total of 9 (nine) pages, including all=20
content and references, and must be in PDF format and formatted=20
according to the new Standard ACM Conference Proceedings Template.


For LaTeX users: unzip acmart.zip, make, and use sample-sigconf.tex as a=20
template; Additional information about formatting and style files is=20
available online at:=20
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Papers that do=20
not meet the formatting requirements will be rejected without review.


Website Submissions for KDD 2018 are being accepted at:=20
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dkdd18


**********************
Important policies
**********************


- Reproducibility
Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical=20
quality, potential impact, insightfulness, depth, clarity, and=20
reproducibility. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and=20
data publicly available whenever possible. Algorithms and resources used=20
in a paper should be described as completely as possible to allow=20
reproducibility. This includes experimental methodology, empirical=20
evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an=20
important role in the assessment of each submission.


- Authorship
Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed=20
substantially both to the work described in the paper and to the writing=20
of the paper. Every listed author must take responsibility for the=20
entire content of a paper. Persons who do not meet these requirements=20
may be acknowledged, but should not be listed as authors.=20
Post-submission changes to the author list are not allowed.


- Dual submissions
Submitted papers must describe work that is substantively different from=20
work that has already been published, or accepted for publication, or=20
submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. However, there=20
are several exceptions to this rule:
1. Submission is permitted for a shorter version of a paper submitted to=20
a journal, but not yet published. Authors must declare such=20
dual-submissions on the submission form and must ensure that the journal=20
in question allows concurrent submissions to conferences.
2. Submissions are permitted for papers presented or to be presented at=20
seminars, conferences or workshops without proceedings.
3. Submissions are permitted for papers that have previously been made=20
available only in the form of technical report with no peer reviews, in=20
particular on arXiv.


**********************
Conflicts of interest
**********************
During the submission process, enter the email domains of all=20
institutions with which you have an institutional conflict of interest.=20
You have an institutional conflict of interest if you are currently=20
employed or have been employed at this institution in the past three=20
years, or you have extensively collaborated with this institution within=20
the past three years. Authors are also required to identify all PC/SPC=20
members with whom they have a conflict of interest, eg, advisor,=20
student, colleague, or coauthor in the last five years.


************
Attendance
************
For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference=20
and present the paper. Authors of all accepted papers must prepare a=20
final version for publication, a poster, and a three-minute short video=20
presentation.


************
Copyright
************
Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by ACM=20
and also appear in the ACM Digital Library. The rights retained by=20
authors who transfer copyright to ACM can be found here.
AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the=20
proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date for=20
KDD 2018 is on or after Jul 11, 2018. The official publication date=20
affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
