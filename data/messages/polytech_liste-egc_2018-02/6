Subject: [liste-egc] Post-doctoral position in Interpretable Machine
 Learning, Paris

University Paris 6 (Paris, France), team NutriOmics, is looking for a  
post-doctoral researcher to work on discrete classifiers  
(interpretable scoring systems) in a context of an ANR-funded  
DiagnoLearn project (coordinator Nataliya Sokolovska). The position is  
for 1 year, the extension of the contract is possible.

We expect a candidate to have a PhD in Computer Science/Machine  
Learning or any related field, have experience in supervised  
classification and numerical optimisation. The DiagnoLearn project  
focuses on learning of scoring systems which are simple linear  
classification models that are based on addition, subtraction, and  
multiplication of a few small numbers. These models are applied to  
make quick predictions. Traditionally, a problem in supervised machine  
learning is cast as a binary or multi-class classification where the  
goal is to learn real-valued weights of a model. However, although the  
generalizing error is an important criterion, in some applications,  
the interpretability of a model plays even a more significant role.  
Most machine learning methods produce highly complex models, not  
designed to provide explanations about predictions. Clinical scoring  
systems are of particular interest since they are expected to predict  
a state of a patient and to help physicians to provide accurate  
diagnostics. It is a challenge to learn a scoring system in an  
automated way, purely from data. Among the state-of-the art approaches  
to learn interpretable models are the SLIM (Supersparse Linear Integer  
Models) introduced in B. Ustun and C. Rudin "Supersparse linear  
integer models for optimized medical scoring systems", Machine  
Learning, 2015, and the Fully Corrective Binning (N. Sokolovska, Y.  
Chevaleyre and J.-D. Zucker. A Provable Algorithm for Learning  
Interpretable Scoring Systems. AISTATS, 2018, accepted.)

The successful candidate will join the team NutriOmics, the University  
Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris 6).

Location: Hospital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, 75013

The position remains open until filled

Duration: 1 year (extension is possible)
