***NEWS************NEWS************NEWS************NEWS************NEWS************NEWS************NEWS*****************

The annual DaWaK conference is a high-quality forum for researchers, 
practitioners and developers in the field of Big Data Analytics, in a 
broad sense, with a database systems focus. The objective is to explore, 
disseminate and exchange knowledge in this field through scientific and 
industry talks. The conference covers all aspects of DaWaK research and 
practice, including data lakes (schema-free repositories), database 
design (data warehouse design, ER modeling), big data management (tables 
+ text + files), query languages (SQL and beyond), parallel systems 
technology (Spark, MapReduce, HDFS), theoretical foundations and 
innovative applications, bringing together active researchers from the 
database systems, cloud computing, programming languages and data 
science communities worldwide.

Submissions presenting research work on both systems and theoretical 
aspects of Big Data modeling, storage, query processing and large-scale 
machine learning are highly encouraged. Submissions on industrial 
applications and interesting experiences involving big data technology 
are also encouraged. Papers revisiting classical data mining problems 
from a big data perspective are encouraged. Generic machine learning or 
"theoretical" data mining papers without systems, scalability or 
parallel processing aspects are discouraged (i.e. papers with heavy 
mathematical content, but no parallel systems or challenging programming 
aspects). The topics include, but they are not limited to, the following 
list:


- Theoretical Models for Extended Data Warehouses and Big Data
- Parallel Processing
- Parallel DBMS technology
- Schema-free data repositories
- Modeling diverse big data sources (e.g. text)
- Conceptual Model Foundations for Big Data
- Query Languages
- Query processing and Optimization
- Cost Models for advanced optimization
- Semantics for Big Data Intelligence
- Data warehouses, data lakes
- Big Data Storage and Indexing
- Big Data Analytics: algorithms, techniques, and systems
- Big Data Quality and Provenance Control
- Distributed system architectures
- Exploiting hardware to accelerate processing: multicore CPUs, cache 
memory, GPUs
- Cloud Infrastructure to manage big data
- Scalability and Parallelization using MapReduce, Spark and related systems
- Graph analytics, including social networks and the Internet
- Visualization
- Big Data Search and Discovery
- Big Data Management for Mobile Applications
- Analytics for Unstructured, Semi-structured, and Structured Data
- Analytics for Temporal, Spatial, Spatio-temporal, and Mobile Data
- Analytics for Data Streams and Sensor Data
- Analytics for Big Multimedia Data
- Real-time/Right-time and Event-based Analytics
- Privacy and Security in Analytics
- Big Data Application Deployment
- Pre-processing and data cleaning to build analytic data sets
- Integration of Data Warehousing, OLAP Cubes and Data Mining
- Analytic workflows

Conference Program Committee Co-Chairs
- Carlos Ordonez, University of Houston, USA
- Ladjel Bellatreche, ISAE-ENSMA, France


Paper Submission Details

Authors are invited to electronically submit original research 
contributions or experience reports in English. Submitted papers will be 
carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical 
soundness, and clarity of exposition.

The submitted manuscript should closely reflect the final paper as it 
will appear in the Proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be 
submitted in pdf in LNCS format 
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)
The length of submitted manuscripts should not exceed 15 pages. Any 
submission that significantly exceeds length limits or deviates from 
formatting requirements may be rejected without review. For paper 
registration and electronic submission visit 
http://confdriver.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dexa2018


Duplicate submissions are not allowed. Authors are expected to agree to 
the following terms: "I understand that the submission must not overlap 
substantially with any other paper that I am a co-author of or that is 
currently submitted elsewhere. Furthermore, previously published papers 
with any overlap are cited prominently in this submission."

Submitted papers will be double checked for duplicate submission 
comparing them to public paper repositories. Duplicate submissions will 
be rejected immediately without further review. Questions about this 
policy or how it applies to aÂ  specific paper should be directed to the 
PC Co-chairs.

Accepted Papers

After a competitive selection process, DaWaK can accept papers as full 
or short papers. DaWaK reserves the right to accept papers with some 
weaknesses or not mature enough as short papers (up to 8 pages). Short 
papers describe interesting and innovative ideas which still require 
further technical development. All accepted conference papers will be 
published in a volume of "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" (LNCS) by 
Springer Verlag. Authors of all accepted papers will have to sign a 
Springer copyright release form. Papers are accepted with the 
understanding that at least one author will register for the conference 
to present the paper. Papers without any registered author or co-author 
will not be published.


For further inquiries, please contact the DaWaK 2018 PC chairs.
