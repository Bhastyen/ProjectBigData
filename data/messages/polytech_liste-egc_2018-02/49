Workshop Description and Scope:
With the increasing availability of unstructured and semistructured text =
data in the form of user-generated content and digitized corpora, =
GIScience is recently actively exploring the potential of this data to =
answer some of the traditional as well as new questions. Interestingly, =
the word =E2=80=9Ccorpus=E2=80=9D is only used seldom in this research =
=E2=80=93 =E2=80=9Ccollection=E2=80=9D is the preferred term.  As the =
range of questions addressed through various corpora expands, it is high =
time for the GIScience community to gain an overview of emerging work as =
well as reflect upon some important corpus-related questions: Aren=E2=80=99=
t we doing =E2=80=9Cbutterfly collecting=E2=80=9D[1] at best and being =
opportunistic at worst? Do concepts such as =E2=80=9Clanguage in use=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Crepresentativeness=E2=80=9D matter or should we take a =
pragmatic approach and only question, =E2=80=9CIs corpus A good for task =
B=E2=80=9D?
The aim of this workshop is to provide an overview of existing (types =
of) corpora, methods and research questions addressed through text =
corpora in GIScience, as well as to discuss the importance of aspects =
such as corpus characteristics or representativeness.
The scope of the workshop includes the following:
	=E2=80=A2 characteristics of existing geospatial and general =
corpora (including Web as a corpus, digitized corpora)
	=E2=80=A2 corpus-building strategies and frameworks
	=E2=80=A2 making a corpus publicly available: tools and pitfalls
	=E2=80=A2 methods for spatial and thematic exploration of a =
corpus (geographic information retrieval and beyond)
	=E2=80=A2 development of spatial markup languages
	=E2=80=A2 approaches to annotation of large corpora (including =
crowdsourcing)
	=E2=80=A2 areas of application of corpus-based and =E2=80=93driven=
 research in GIScience: from environmental monitoring to the =
investigation of variation in the use of spatial language

Submissions:
We invite contributions discussing (early) ongoing work relevant to one =
or more of the topics listed above. Submissions should be between 6 and =
8 pages in length and should follow the GIScience 2018 formatting =
guidelines. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the =
program committee, accepted papers will be included in the GIScience =
digital conference proceedings.=20
The deadline for the submissions is April 28, 2018, review decisions =
will be provided to authors on May 28, 2018.
