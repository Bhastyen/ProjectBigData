BPM 2018 - 16th International Conference on Business Process Management
Call for Papers

September 9-14, 2018, Sydney, Australia.

http://bpm2018.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/

---------------------------

The annual BPM conference is the premium forum for researchers and
practitioners in business process management. BPM is a broad discipline,
covering topics that range from formal methods in computer science to
techniques in information systems engineering, to management science
methods. Therefore, not only different research topics are addressed,
but also different research methods are employed that require different
evaluation criteria in the peer reviewing process.

To accommodate for this diversity, the BPM conference introduces a new
structure. This structure is based on three tracks that cover not only
different phenomena of interest and research methods but, consequently,
also different evaluation criteria. To implement this structure, each
track has a dedicated track chair and a dedicated program committee. The
track chairs, together with a consolidation chair, are responsible for
the scientific program. Through this new structure we aim to broaden the
BPM community and position the BPM conference as a forum for all aspects
of the broad business process management discipline.


TRACK I: FOUNDATIONS

Track I invites papers that follow computer science research methods.
This includes papers that investigate the underlying principles of BPM
systems, computational theories, algorithms, and methods for modeling
and analyzing business processes. This track also covers papers on novel
languages, architectures, and other concepts underlying process aware
information systems, as well as papers that use conceptual modeling
techniques to investigate problems in the design and analysis of BPM
systems. Papers in Track I are evaluated according to computer science
standards, including sound formalization, convincing argumentation, and,
where applicable, proof of concept implementation, which shows that the
concepts can be implemented as described. Since papers typically do not
have an immediate application in concrete business environments,
empirical evaluation does not play a major role in Track I.


You should send your paper to Track I if:

- It provides foundational results about the underlying principles and
concepts of BPM systems.
- It advances the state of the art in BPM through the investigation of
formal methods and algorithms.
- It contributes to the definition of novel concepts, languages, and
architectures for BPM systems.
- It tackles conceptual modelling issues of BPM systems and their
environment.
- It investigates novel concepts of BPM systems through the development
of proof-of-concept implementations.


Track Chair: Marco Montali

Senior PC: Florian Daniel, Dirk Fahland, Giancarlo Guizzardi, Thomas
Hildebrandt, Marcello La Rosa, John Mylopoulos, Manfred Reichert,
Jianwen Su, Hagen Völzer, Matthias Weidlich.


TRACK II: ENGINEERING

Track II invites papers that follow information systems engineering
methods. The focus is on the investigation of artifacts and systems in
business environments, following the design science approach. Papers in
this track are expected to have a strong empirical evaluation that
critically tests criteria like usefulness or added value of the proposed
artifact. This track covers business process intelligence, including
process mining techniques, and the use of process models for enactment,
model-driven engineering, as well as interaction with services and
deployment architectures like the Cloud. It also covers BPM systems in
particular domains, such as digital health, smart mobility, or Internet
of Things. Empirical evaluations are important to show the merits of the
artifact introduced. A self-critical discussion of threats to validity
is expected. Formalization of problems and solutions should be used
where they add clarity or are beneficial in other ways.

You should send your paper to Track II if:
- It has a significant technical contribution.
- Its results are empirically evaluated.
- It reports on a system that you designed, with a maturity of at least
a prototype. i.e., it can be evaluated in an application context.
- It follows the design science approach.

Track Chair: Ingo Weber

Senior PC: Wil van der Aalst, Boualem Benatallah, Boudewijn van Dongen,
Jan Mendling, Cesare Pautasso, Hajo Reijers, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Pnina
Soffer, Barbara Weber, Jianmin Wang


TRACK III: MANAGEMENT

Track III invites papers that aim at advancing our understanding of how
BPM can deliver business value, for instance how it builds
organizational capabilities to improve, innovate or transform the
respective business. Papers that study the application and impact of BPM
methods and tools in use contexts based on empirical observation are
highly welcome.

Areas of interest include a wide range of capability areas that are
relevant for BPM, such as strategic alignment, governance, methods,
information technology, and human aspects including people and culture.
We seek contributions that advance our understanding on how
organizations can develop such capabilities in order to achieve specific
objectives in given organizational contexts. Papers may use various
strategies of inquiry, including case study research, action research,
focus group research, big data analytics research, neuroscience
research, econometric research, literature review research, survey
research or design science research. Papers will be evaluated according
to management and information systems standards.

Authors of selected papers in this track will be invited to submit
revised and extended versions of their work for a special issue in the
European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS) on “Business Process
Management and Digital Innovation”.

You should send your paper to Track III if:
- It makes a contribution to an organizational challenge.
- It builds on and draws from real-world organizational endeavors in BPM.
- It extends the BPM body of knowledge to better contribute to strategy
delivery.
- It advances our understanding and methodology of BPM to support
digital innovation.
- It contributes to solving grand societal challenges through BPM.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Each paper will be submitted to exactly one track. Please use the track
descriptions above to decide where to send your paper. Authors may
contact track chairs for clarification. Papers must be formatted
according to Springer's LNCS formatting guidelines. Submissions must be
in English and must not exceed 16 pages. The title page must contain a
short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics
above. The paper must clearly state the problem being addressed, the
goal of the work, the results achieved, and the relation to other work.
Student papers are treated as regular papers in the review process.
Importantly, the contribution underlying a student paper must be carried
out mainly by the student(s), but others (advisors, collaborators, etc.)
can appear as authors as well. When submitting the paper, student papers
must be clearly marked as such in the EasyChair system. To be eligible
for the best student paper award, student papers have to be presented at
the conference by a student author.


Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the BPM 2018
EasyChair submission site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2018.

Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been
published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals
while being submitted to BPM 2018. Authors are encouraged to adhere to
the best practices of Reproducible Research (RR), by making available
data and software tools for reproducing the results reported in their
papers.

Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published
by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. For each
accepted paper, at least one author must register for the conference and
present the paper. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit
an extended version to special issues in Elsevier’s Information Systems
(Tracks I and II) and in Palgrave’s European Journal of Information
Systems (Track III).

The BPM Forum will host innovative research which has high potential of
stimulating discussion at the conference but does not fully meet the
quality criteria for the main conference. Those papers will be invited
to the BPM Forum and published in full length in a separate
post-proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Business Information
Processing series, as well as being presented during the main
conference. There will not be short papers at the conference.

First-time submitters to BPM may request to be considered for a
pre-submission shepherding program in which a selected BPM PC member
advises on the presentation and positioning of a shepherded paper.
Interested candidates are encouraged to contact the PC Chairs
(bpm2018@easychair.org) by 23 January, 2018.

    ---------------------------
    <br>
    <br>
    The annual BPM conference is the premium forum for researchers and
    <br>
    practitioners in business process management. BPM is a broad
    discipline,
    <br>
    covering topics that range from formal methods in computer science
    to
    <br>
    techniques in information systems engineering, to management science
    <br>
    methods. Therefore, not only different research topics are
    addressed,
    <br>
    but also different research methods are employed that require
    different
    <br>
    evaluation criteria in the peer reviewing process.
    <br>
    <br>
    To accommodate for this diversity, the BPM conference introduces a
    new
    <br>
    structure. This structure is based on three tracks that cover not
    only
    <br>
    different phenomena of interest and research methods but,
    consequently,
    <br>
    also different evaluation criteria. To implement this structure,
    each
    <br>
    track has a dedicated track chair and a dedicated program committee.
    The
    <br>
    track chairs, together with a consolidation chair, are responsible
    for
    <br>
    the scientific program. Through this new structure we aim to broaden
    the
    <br>
    BPM community and position the BPM conference as a forum for all
    aspects
    <br>
    of the broad business process management discipline.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    TRACK I: FOUNDATIONS
    <br>
    <br>
    Track I invites papers that follow computer science research
    methods.
    <br>
    This includes papers that investigate the underlying principles of
    BPM
    <br>
    systems, computational theories, algorithms, and methods for
    modeling
    <br>
    and analyzing business processes. This track also covers papers on
    novel
    <br>
    languages, architectures, and other concepts underlying process
    aware
    <br>
    information systems, as well as papers that use conceptual modeling
    <br>
    techniques to investigate problems in the design and analysis of BPM
    <br>
    systems. Papers in Track I are evaluated according to computer
    science
    <br>
    standards, including sound formalization, convincing argumentation,
    and,
    <br>
    where applicable, proof of concept implementation, which shows that
    the
    <br>
    concepts can be implemented as described. Since papers typically do
    not
    <br>
    have an immediate application in concrete business environments,
    <br>
    empirical evaluation does not play a major role in Track I.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You should send your paper to Track I if:
    <br>
    <br>
    - It provides foundational results about the underlying principles
    and
    <br>
    concepts of BPM systems.
    <br>
    - It advances the state of the art in BPM through the investigation
    of
    <br>
    formal methods and algorithms.
    <br>
    - It contributes to the definition of novel concepts, languages, and
    <br>
    architectures for BPM systems.
    <br>
    - It tackles conceptual modelling issues of BPM systems and their
    <br>
    environment.
    <br>
    - It investigates novel concepts of BPM systems through the
    development
    <br>
    of proof-of-concept implementations.
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    TRACK II: ENGINEERING
    <br>
    <br>
    Track II invites papers that follow information systems engineering
    <br>
    methods. The focus is on the investigation of artifacts and systems
    in
    <br>
    business environments, following the design science approach. Papers
    in
    <br>
    this track are expected to have a strong empirical evaluation that
    <br>
    critically tests criteria like usefulness or added value of the
    proposed
    <br>
    artifact. This track covers business process intelligence, including
    <br>
    process mining techniques, and the use of process models for
    enactment,
    <br>
    model-driven engineering, as well as interaction with services and
    <br>
    deployment architectures like the Cloud. It also covers BPM systems
    in
    <br>
    particular domains, such as digital health, smart mobility, or
    Internet
    <br>
    of Things. Empirical evaluations are important to show the merits of
    the
    <br>
    artifact introduced. A self-critical discussion of threats to
    validity
    <br>
    is expected. Formalization of problems and solutions should be used
    <br>
    where they add clarity or are beneficial in other ways.
    <br>
    <br>
    You should send your paper to Track II if:
    <br>
    - It has a significant technical contribution.
    <br>
    - Its results are empirically evaluated.
    <br>
    - It reports on a system that you designed, with a maturity of at
    least
    <br>
    a prototype. i.e., it can be evaluated in an application context.
    <br>
    - It follows the design science approach.

    TRACK III: MANAGEMENT
    <br>
    <br>
    Track III invites papers that aim at advancing our understanding of
    how
    <br>
    BPM can deliver business value, for instance how it builds
    <br>
    organizational capabilities to improve, innovate or transform the
    <br>
    respective business. Papers that study the application and impact of
    BPM
    <br>
    methods and tools in use contexts based on empirical observation are
    <br>
    highly welcome.
    <br>
    <br>
    Areas of interest include a wide range of capability areas that are
    <br>
    relevant for BPM, such as strategic alignment, governance, methods,
    <br>
    information technology, and human aspects including people and
    culture.
    <br>
    We seek contributions that advance our understanding on how
    <br>
    organizations can develop such capabilities in order to achieve
    specific
    <br>
    objectives in given organizational contexts. Papers may use various
    <br>
    strategies of inquiry, including case study research, action
    research,
    <br>
    focus group research, big data analytics research, neuroscience
    <br>
    research, econometric research, literature review research, survey
    <br>
    research or design science research. Papers will be evaluated
    according
    <br>
    to management and information systems standards.
    <br>
    <br>
    Authors of selected papers in this track will be invited to submit
    <br>
    revised and extended versions of their work for a special issue in
    the
    <br>
    European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS) on “Business Process
    <br>
    Management and Digital Innovation”.
    <br>
    <br>
    You should send your paper to Track III if:
    <br>
    - It makes a contribution to an organizational challenge.
    <br>
    - It builds on and draws from real-world organizational endeavors in
    BPM.
    <br>
    - It extends the BPM body of knowledge to better contribute to
    strategy
    <br>
    delivery.
    <br>
    - It advances our understanding and methodology of BPM to support
    <br>
    digital innovation.
    <br>
    - It contributes to solving grand societal challenges through BPM.
