CFP: 4th Workshop on Sentic Computing, Sentiment Analysis, Opinion =
Mining, and Emotion Detection
at ESWC, Heraklion, Crete, Greece, 2018
Workshop URL: http://www.maurodragoni.com/research/opinionmining/events/ =
<http://www.maurodragoni.com/research/opinionmining/events/>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D



With the rapid growth of Web a plethora of information is being =
published on-line by users on social networks, online communities, =
blogs, wikis, etc. This collective intelligence has spread to many =
different areas, with particular focus on fields related to everyday =
life such as commerce, tourism, education, and health, causing the size =
of the social Web to expand exponentially.

To identify the emotions (e.g. sentiment polarity, sadness, happiness, =
anger, irony, sarcasm, etc.) and the modality (e.g. doubt, certainty, =
obligation, liability, desire, etc.) expressed in this continuously =
growing content is critical to enable the correct interpretation of the =
opinions expressed or reported about social events, political movements, =
company strategies, marketing campaigns, product preferences, etc. by =
the masses. This has attracted the attention of scientific community, by =
providing it with new research challenges, as well as in the business =
world, as applications such as marketing and financial prediction would =
gain remarkable benefits.

Based on the lessons learned from the three previous editions, this year =
the scope of the workshop is a bit broader (although still focusing on a =
very specific domain) and accepted submissions will include abstracts =
and position papers in addition to full papers. The workshop's main =
focus will be discussion rather than presentations, which are seen as =
seeds for boosting discussion topics, and an expected result will be a =
joint manifesto and a research roadmap that will provide the Semantic =
Web community with inspiring research challenges.

=3D=3D TOPICS =3D=3D

The main topics include but are not limited to:

* Ontologies and knowledge bases for emotion recognition
* Topic and entity based emotion recognition
* Semantics in the evolution of emotions within and across social media =
systems and topics
* Semantic processing of social media for emotion recognition
* Contextualised emotion recognition
* Comparison of semantic approaches for emotion recognition
* Personalised semantic emotion recognition and monitoring
* Using semantics for prediction of emotions towards events, people, =
organisations, etc.
* Baselines and datasets for semantic emotion recognition
* Semantics in stream-based emotion recognition
* Comparison between semantic and non-semantic approaches for emotion =
recognition
* Multimodal emotion recognition
* Multilingual sentiment analysis
* Challenges in using semantics for emotion recognition
* Retrieval of emotion-based documents from repositories
* Deep learning and knowledge-enabled approaches for sentiment analysis
* Big Data tools and techniques for sentiment analysis
* Applications of sentiment analysis within specific domains (e.g. =
health, robotics)
