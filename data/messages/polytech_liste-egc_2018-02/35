                      Call For Papers
    The Third International Workshop on Smart Sensing Systems (IWSSS '18)
             http://iwsss2018.puc.pu-toyama.ac.jp/
                        Rome, Italy
                 June 25, 2018 (tentative)
               in conjunction with the 14th International Conference
                on Intelligent Environments

                 in cooperation with Smart Sensing Systems Group,
       the Society of Instrument and Control System (SICE) [to be approved]

During the past years, sensing technologies have become an important field
in
 computer science and technologies as seen in the trend of cyber physical
systems (CPS), machine-to-machine (M2M) systems, and the Internet of
Things
(IoT). Researchers in sensing technologies provide technological means to
capture
environmental, technical, physiological and other data. They provide the
raw
materials on which smart applications and services will be built. Sensor
data
are the basis for the smart world. Due to various characteristics of sensor
data
and their corresponding processing requirements, such as multisource,
heterogeneous,
real-time, voluminous, continuous, streaming, ever-expanding and
spatio-temporal,
many traditional data processing and integration approaches begin to show
their
limitations, particularly when dealing with situations like sensor data and
its
application deluge.
Streaming data analysis, knowledge extraction (data mining, machine
learning)
and complex event processing are required to treat and preprocess these
data,
to detect correlations in data and to discover patterns or abnormalities
in
dynamically evolving situations. Data files as well as data streams need to
be
treated.  A variety of representations exist depending on the Web-based
systems,
thus, the means for handling, storing and accessing this information to
make
valuable decisions need to be studied.
Semantic web technologies have provided particular means to this aim.
Social
applications, and ubiquitous and pervasive computing are examples of areas
making
use of semantised sensed or processed data. Semantisation, privacy, trust,
context
awareness, community management, and data visualization are the core issues
related
to this area. We aim to bring together topics from several layers of data
processing;
from devices to services to enable novel ideas and collaboration combining
the
information from multiple sources.
The workshop intends to provide a forum for exchange of experience among
researchers
from industry and academia actively involved in research, development and
evaluation
of new concepts, theoretical methods and experimental characterization and
for
debating different innovative solutions. Practitioners involved in
applications
domains are also welcome to present their tasks and to participate in these
discussions.
The workshop will feature a selective technical program consisting of
regular research
papers as well position talks.

We invite authors to submit original research to present latest
progresses,
determine future goals, and show techniques for future development in the
field.
