mathematically based techniques model  design    analyze computing systems  techniques aim improving   dependability computing systems  different techniques may required   throughout development life cycle cover different aspects   system    machine learning nowadays deep neural networks match human abilities   various tasks  solutions based machine learning ubiquitous    automated medical diagnosis self driving cars security  however    machine learning offer guarantees reasoning techniques prove   dependability automated decisions  systems must   verified validated using existing techniques call new techniques    formal reasoning techniques needed arrive well explain   deductive even inductive conclusions    year workshop dedicated memory prof  thouraya   bouabana tebibel
