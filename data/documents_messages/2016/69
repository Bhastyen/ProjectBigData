information coded many different languages  recent statistics  http   www internetlivestats com internet users  byregion  reported non english contents represent half information available internet  fact witnessed growing popularity tools designed collaboratively editing contributors across world  led increased demand methods capable effectively efficiently searching  retrieving  managing mining different language written document collections  multilingual information overload phenomenon introduces new challenges modern information retrieval systems  better searching  indexing  organizing rich heterogeneous information  discover exchange knowledge larger world wide scale however  since research multilingual information relatively young  important issues still remain  including   define translation independent representation documents across many languages   whether existing solutions comparable corpora enhanced generalize multiple languages without depending bilingual dictionaries incurring bias merging language specific results   profitably exploit knowledge bases enable translation independent preserving unveiling content semantics   define proper indexing structures multidimensional data structures better capture multi topic multi aspect nature documents multilingual context   detect duplicate redundant information among different languages  conversely  novelty
